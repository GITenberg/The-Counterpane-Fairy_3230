<p><font size="5">T was Sunday afternoon, and everything was very
still.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy had been allowed to sit up that morning
for the first time since he had been ill. He had put on the
little blue dressing-gown that mamma had made for him, and she
was so funny about getting him into it, and wheeling the chair
over to the window, that Teddy had laughed and
laughed.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After that he sat at the window looking out and
watching the chickens in the yard below, and the people going
along the street.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy's mamma was going to church, but his
father stayed home with the little boy, and told him stories, and
drew pictures with a blue pencil on a writing-pad; pictures of
"David Killing Goliath," and of "Daniel in the Lions'
Den."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then he drew a picture of the house in the real
country where he and mamma and Teddy were going to live some time
--a house with a barn, and horses, and cows, and pigs, and a pony
that Teddy could ride when he came in to town to
school.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The morning flew by so quickly that the little
boy was surprised when mamma came back from church, and said it
was almost time for luncheon.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">She looked at the pictures that papa had drawn,
and smiled when Teddy told her about them; but very soon she
began to talk seriously with papa. She told him she had stopped
in at Mrs. McFinney's on her way home, and that she had been
wondering whether something couldn't be done for little Ellen
McFinney's lameness. She felt so sorry for her.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Papa said the child ought to be sent to a
hospital, and he thought that if that were done she could be
cured. Mamma said that she thought so too; but that someone had
been talking to little Ellen, and frightened her so that she
cried whenever the hospital was talked of, and her mother would
not send her unless she felt willing to go.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then mamma spoke of how lonely it must be for
the little girl there in the house by herself all the day, while
her mother was out at work, with so little to amuse
her.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Mamma," said Teddy, "why can't little Ellen
have some of my books to amuse her-- some I had when I was sick?
Because, you know, I'm well now, and don't need them any
more."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"That's a very good idea," said mamma, looking
pleased. "You may choose the ones you will give her, and perhaps
papa will leave them with her when he goes out for a walk this
afternoon."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well," cried Teddy, eagerly, "I think I'll
give her the <i>Ali Baba</i> book and <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, and
I think, maybe, I'll give her <i>Little Golden Locks</i>
too."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Mamma brought the books, and they tied them up
in a neat package, and just as they finished there was a little
rattle of china outside the door, and in came Hannah with Teddy's
luncheon, and a great yellow orange that Aunt Pauline had sent
him.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After luncheon mamma made Teddy lie down for a
while to rest. The Venetian shutters were drawn, so that all the
room was dimly green, and then mamma and papa went out and left
him alone.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy lay there for what seemed to him a long
time. The house was very still, and the afternoon sun shone in
through the slats of the shutters in golden chinks and
lines.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy wondered where mamma was, and why she
didn't come back, for it seemed to him that he had been alone
almost all the afternoon, though really it had not been for
long.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Presently he heard someone humming cheerfully
back of the counterpane hill, and as soon as he heard it he felt
sure that the Counterpane Fairy must be coming.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Sure enough in a few minutes she appeared at
the top and stood looking down at him with a pleasant smile. "Oh,
Mrs. Fairy, I knew that was you!" cried Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Did you?" said the fairy, sitting down on top
of his knees. "And then did you think, 'Now I shall see another
story'?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, yes!" cried Teddy, eagerly. "I hoped you
would show me one."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Then I suppose I'll have to," said the fairy.
"And what square shall it be this time?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"There's one close by you," said Teddy, "and
it's most every color, like a rainbow. Will you show me that
story?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes," said the fairy, "I'll show you that. Now
fix your eyes on it." Then she began to count.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"FORTY-NINE!" she cried.</font></p>

<center><font size="5">* * * * * * * *</font></center>

<p><font size="5">Teddy and little Ellen McFinney were running
along, hand in hand, over a rainbow that stretched across the
shining sky like a bridge. The clouds above them shone like
opals, and far, far below was the green world, with shining
rivers, and houses that looked no larger than walnuts.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Can't we run fast?" said Teddy. "I think we go
as fast as an express train; don't you, Ellen?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I know a faster way to go than this," said the
little girl.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Do you?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, I do. Let go of my hand, and I'll show
you." She drew her hand away from Teddy, and very slowly she
leaned back against the air as though it were a pillow, then she
gave herself a little push with her feet, and away she floated so
lightly and easily that Teddy could hardly keep up with
her.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, Ellen!" cried Teddy, "will you teach me to
do that?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, I will," said Ellen. So she stood up and
showed Teddy how to take a long breath, and how to push himself,
and then he found he could do it quite well, and when Ellen began
to float too, they could go along together hand in hand just as
they had before.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Suddenly a thought crossed Teddy's mind, and he
cried, "Why, Ellen, I thought you were lame!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"So I am," said the little girl.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"But you can run and float."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, I know, but that's because I'm
dreaming."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Why, no, Ellen, you can't be dreaming," said
Teddy, "for I'm here too."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well, I don't know," said Ellen, "but I think
I'm dreaming, because I've often dreamed this way
before."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy thought of this for a little while, but
it was not pleasant to think that he was in a dream. After a
while he said: "Ellen, don't you know, if you're lame you ought
to go to a hospital? My mamma says so, and my papa says so
too."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">An ugly expression came into Ellen's face.
"That's all you know about it," she cried. "You don't catch me
going to a hospital. Why, I heard of a girl that went to a
hospital and--"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">She was interrupted by a soft burst of
laughter, and looking about Teddy saw that he and she had floated
right into midst of a group of little children, who were running
along the rainbow bridge. They were all such pretty little
children, with soft shining faces and bare feet, but they did not
quite look like any children that Teddy had ever seen
before.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Each little child carried in its hand a bunch
of flowers, and they were such flowers as the little boy had
never dreamed of. Some of them moved on their stalks, opening and
closing their petals softly like the wings of butterflies, some
shone like jewels, and some seemed to change and throb as if with
a hidden pulse of life.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Ellen, who had stopped floating, caught Teddy
by the coat and hung back timidly when she saw the children, but
Teddy spoke to the one nearest to him. "Where did you get your
flowers?" he asked.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"From the garden at the other end of the
rainbow," said the little child, smiling at him.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Give me one?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, no, I can't!" answered the child, staring
at him with big eyes. "They're for someone else."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Whom are they for?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"You can come along and see."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, say," whispered Ellen to Teddy, "let's go
back!" But Teddy answered: "No, no! Come on and see where they're
going." So Ellen reluctantly followed him, and they joined the
other little children journeying along the rainbow.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The strange little children seemed very happy,
and they laughed and talked together in their soft, clear voices,
though Teddy could not always understand what they said. He could
understand best the little boy to whom he had spoken first. Teddy
asked him again where they were going, and this time the little
boy (he seemed to be the captain of the band) told him that they
were going down to the earth. He said that every week they had a
holiday, and then they crossed the rainbow bridge, and carried
the flowers from their flower-beds down to the little earth
children.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"But <i>what</i> little children?" asked Teddy,
curiously.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, you'll see!" answered the little boy,
laughing, and then he began to talk with the others, and Teddy
could no longer understand him.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">It was not long after this that Teddy saw
before him the end of the rainbow, and where should it go but
right through the window of a great square yellow house, set back
of a high wall and in the middle of a lawn.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh dear! we can't get to the end of it after
all," cried Teddy, and the next thing he knew the little children
were walking through the window just as if nothing were there,
and he and Ellen were following them.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Where are we?" asked Ellen, looking about her,
half frightened and yet curious.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I can't think," said Teddy. "Seems as if I
knew, but I can't think."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">They were in a long, bare, clean room, and on
each side of it were rows of little white beds, and in each bed
lay or sat a little child. A few of the children were asleep,
most of them were awake, but all looked pale and thin. Here and
there at the sides of the beds grown-up people were sitting,
sometimes showing the children pictures or books, and sometimes
reading to them.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The children from the rainbow walked slowly up
the aisle between the row of beds, and, strangely enough, no one
seemed to look at them or pay the least attention, any more than
if they had not been there, and at last Teddy began to believe
that they could not see them.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Often the little strange children stopped to
smooth a pillow or to softly stroke the cheek or hand of one of
the little earth children.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Here and there one would linger behind the
others, by some bed, and after a moment would lay its bunch of
flowers on the pillow. Then the little child in the bed would
turn its head and smile, even if it were asleep, and its face
would shine as if with some inward happiness. The whole room
seemed filled with the perfume of flowers, and Teddy wondered
that no one paid any attention to it.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">At last they came to a bed where a little child
was lying fast asleep, and a woman was sitting beside the child
and fanning it. Suddenly its eyes opened, and the moment they
turned toward the rainbow children, Teddy knew that it saw
them.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">It lay looking for a moment and then it smiled
and feebly tried to wave its hand. "What is it, dear?" asked the
woman, bending over the child, but it paid no attention to her,
for it was gazing at the rainbow children.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, he sees us! he sees us!" they cried,
clapping their hands joyfully. "He'll be coming across the
rainbow soon."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then the rainbow children gathered about the
bed and began talking to the child, but Teddy could not
understand what they said to it. The little child on the bed
seemed to understand them though, and it smiled and tried to nod
its head.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Come soon! Come soon!" cried the little
children, waving their hands to it as they moved away, and the
eyes of the child on the bed followed them wistfully, as though
it were eager to follow.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy and Ellen still went with the other
little children, and a moment after they were out on the rainbow
bridge again, high up above the world, but they were alone, for
the little strange children were gone.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Ellen stood still and drew a long breath. "Oh!
wasn't that lovely?" she sighed. "I wonder where it
was!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I know where it was!" cried Teddy suddenly. "I
remember now, for I saw a picture of it in one of papa's
magazines. That was a hospital, Ellen."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"A hospital!" cried the little girl.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, a hospital."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Ellen did not say anything for some time, but
at last she drew another deep breath. "Well, if that's a hospital
I shouldn't mind going to a place like that," she
said.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The rainbow had faded away, and Teddy was back
in the great high-post bedstead again, with the silk coverlet
drawn up over his knees, and the Counterpane Fairy still sitting
on top of the hill. Teddy lay looking at her for a while in
silence. "Mrs. Fairy, was that a true story like the others?" he
asked her at last.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"How should I know?" asked the fairy. "Do I
look as though I knew anything about rainbow children? You'd
better ask Ellen McFinney; maybe she can tell you."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well, I will," said Teddy. "I mean to ask her
just as soon as ever I'm well."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He did not have to wait for that, however, for
the very next day his mother told him that little Ellen had at
last consented to be taken to the hospital, and that perhaps when
he saw the little girl again she would be able to walk and run
about almost like other children.</font></p>
