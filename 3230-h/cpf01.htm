<br>
 EDDY was all alone, for his mother had been up with him so much
the night before that at about four o'clock in the afternoon she
said that she was going to lie down for a little
while.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The room where Teddy lay was very pleasant,
with two big windows, and the furniture covered with gay
old-fashioned India calico. His mother had set a glass of milk on
the table beside his bed, and left the stair door ajar so that he
could call Hannah, the cook, if he wanted anything, and then she
had gone over to her own room.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The little boy had always enjoyed being ill,
for then he was read aloud to and had lemonade, but this had been
a real illness, and though he was better now, the doctor still
would not let him have anything but milk and gruel. He was
feeling rather lonely, too, though the fire crackled cheerfully,
and he could hear Hannah singing to herself in the kitchen
below.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy turned over the leaves of <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i> for a while, looking at the gaily colored pictures,
and then he closed it and called, "Hannah!" The singing in the
kitchen below ceased, and Teddy knew that Hannah was listening.
"Hannah!" he called again.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">At the second call Hannah came hurrying up the
stairs and into the room. "What do you want, Teddy?" she
asked.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Hannah, I want to ask mamma something," said
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh," said Hannah, "you wouldn't want me to
call your poor mother, would you, when she was up with you the
whole of last night and has just gone to lie down a
bit?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I want to ask her something," repeated
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"You ask me what you want to know," suggested
Hannah. "Your poor mother's so tired that I'm sure you are too
much of a man to want me to call her."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well, I want to ask her if I may have a
cracker," said Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, no; you couldn't have that," said Hannah.
"Don't you know that the doctor said you mustn't have anything
but milk and gruel? Did you want to ask her anything
else?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"No," said Teddy, and his lip
trembled.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After that Hannah went down-stairs to her work
again, and Teddy lay staring out of the window at the windy gray
clouds that were sweeping across the April sky. He grew lonelier
and lonelier and a lump rose in his throat; presently a big tear
trickled down his cheek and dripped off his chin.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh dear, oh dear!" said a little voice just
back of the hill his knees made as he lay with them drawn up in
bed; "what a hill to climb!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy stopped crying and gazed wonderingly
toward where the voice came from, and presently over the top of
his knees appeared a brown peaked hood, a tiny withered face, a
flapping brown cloak, and last of all two small feet in buckled
shoes. It was a little old woman, so weazened and brown that she
looked more like a dried leaf than anything else.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">She seated herself on Teddy's knees and gazed
down at him solemnly, and she was so light that he felt her
weight no more than if she had been a feather.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy lay staring at her for a while, and then
he asked, "Who are you?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I'm the Counterpane Fairy," said the little
figure, in a thin little voice.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I don't know what that is," said
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well," said the Counterpane Fairy, "it's the
sort of a fairy that lives in houses and watches out for the
children. I used to be one of the court fairies, but I grew tired
of that. There was nothing in it, you know."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Nothing in what?" asked Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Nothing in the court life. All day the fairies
were swinging in spider-webs and sipping honey-dew, or playing
games of hide-and-go-seek. The only comfort I had was with an old
field-mouse who lived at the edge of the wood, and I used to
spend a great deal of time with her; I used to take care of her
babies when she was out hunting for something to eat; cunning
little things they were, -- five of them, all fat and soft, and
with such funny little tails."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"What became of them?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, they moved away. They left before I did.
As soon as they were old enough, Mother Field-mouse went. She
said she couldn't stand the court fairies. They were always
playing tricks on her, stopping up the door of her house with
sticks and acorns, and making faces at her babies until they
almost drove them into fits. So after that I left
too."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Where did you go?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, hither and yon. Mostly where there were
little sick boys and girls."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Do you like little boys?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, when they don't cry," said the
Counterpane Fairy, staring at him very hard.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well, I was lonely," said Teddy. "I wanted my
mamma."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, I know, but you oughtn't to have cried. I
came to you, though, because you were lonely and sick, and I
thought maybe you would like me to show you a story."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Do you mean <i>tell</i> me a story?" asked
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"No," said the fairy, "I mean show you a story.
It's a game I invented after I joined the Counterpane Fairies.
Choose any one of the squares of the counterpane and I will show
you how to play it. That's all you have to do, -- to choose a
square."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy looked the counterpane over carefully. "I
think I'll choose that yellow square," he said, "because it looks
so nice and bright."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Very well," said the Counterpane Fairy. "Look
straight at it and don't turn your eyes away until I count seven
times seven and then you shall see the story of it."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy fixed his eyes on the square and the
fairy began to count. "One--two--three--four," she counted; Teddy
heard her voice, thin and clear as the hissing of the logs on the
hearth. "Don't look away from the square," she cried.
"Five--six--seven" --it seemed to Teddy that the yellow silk
square was turning to a mist before his eyes and wrapping
everything about him in a golden glow. "Thirteen--fourteen" --the
fairy counted on and on.
"Forty-six--forty-seven--forty-eight--FORTY-NINE!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">At the words forty-nine, the Counterpane Fairy
clapped her hands and Teddy looked about him. He was no longer in
a golden mist. He was standing in a wonderful enchanted garden.
The sky was like the golden sky at sunset, and the grass was so
thickly set with tiny yellow flowers that it looked like a golden
carpet. From this garden stretched a long flight of glass steps.
They reached up and up and up to a great golden castle with
shining domes and turrets.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Listen!" said the Counterpane Fairy. "In that
golden castle there lies an enchanted princess. For more than a
hundred years she has been lying there waiting for the hero who
is to come and rescue her, and you are the hero who can do it if
you will."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">With that the fairy led him to a little pool
close by, and bade him look in the water. When Teddy looked, he
saw himself standing there in the golden garden, and he did not
appear as he ever had before. He was tall and strong and
beautiful, like a hero.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes," said Teddy, "I will do it."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">At these words, from the grass, the bushes, and
the tress around, suddenly started a flock of golden birds. They
circled about him and over him, clapping their wings and singing
triumphantly. Their song reminded Teddy of the blackbirds that
sang on the lawn at home in the early spring, when the daffodils
were up. Then in a moment they were all gone, and the garden was
still again.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Their song had filled his heart with a longing
for great deeds, and, without pausing longer, he ran to the glass
steps and began to mount them.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Up and up and up he went. Once he turned and
waved his hand to the Counterpane Fairy in the golden garden far
below. She waved her hand in answer, and he heard her voice faint
and clear. "Good-bye! Good-bye! Be brave and strong, and beware
of that that is little and gray."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then Teddy turned his face toward the castle,
and in a moment he was standing before the great shining
gates.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He raised his hand and struck bravely upon the
door. There was no answer. Again he struck upon it, and his blow
rang through the hall inside; then he opened the door and went
in.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The hall was five-sided, and all of pure gold,
as clear and shining as glass. Upon three sides of it were three
arched doors; one was of emerald, one was of ruby, and one was of
diamond; they were arched, and tall, and wide, -- fit for a hero
to go through. The question was, behind which one lay the
enchanted princess.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">While Teddy stood there looking at them and
wondering, he heard a little thin voice, that seemed to be
singing to itself, and this is what it sang:</font></p>

<blockquote><font size="5">"In and out and out and in,<br>
 Quick as a flash I weave and spin.<br>
 Some may mistake and some forget,<br>
 But I'll have my spider-web finished yet."</font></blockquote>

<p><font size="5">When Teddy heard the song, he knew that someone
must be awake in the enchanted castle, so he began looking about
him.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">On the fourth side of the wall there hung a
curtain of silvery-gray spider-web, and the voice seemed to come
from it. The hero went toward it, but he saw nothing, for the
spider that was spinning it moved so fast that no eyes could
follow it. Presently it paused up in the left-hand corner of the
web, and then Teddy saw it. It looked very little to have spun
all that curtain of silvery web.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As Teddy stood looking at it, it began to sing
again:</font></p>

<blockquote><font size="5">"Here in my shining web I sit,<br>
 To look about and rest a bit.<br>
 I rest myself a bit and then,<br>
 Quick as a flash, I begin again."</font></blockquote>

<p><font size="5">"Mistress Spinner! Mistress Spinner!" cried
Teddy. "Can you tell me where to find the enchanted princess who
lies asleep waiting for me to come and rescue her?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The spider sat quite still for a while, and
then it said in a voice as thin as a hair: "You must go through
the emerald door; you must go through the emerald door. What so
fit as the emerald door for the hero who would do great
deeds?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy did not so much as stay to thank the
little gray spinner, he was in such a hurry to find the princess,
but turning he sprang to the emerald door, flung it open, and
stepped outside.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He found himself standing on the glass steps,
and as his foot touched the topmost one the whole flight closed
up like an umbrella, and in a moment Teddy was sliding down the
smooth glass pane, faster and faster and faster until he could
hardly catch his breath.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The next thing he knew he was standing in the
golden garden, and there was the Counterpane Fairy beside him
looking at him sadly. "You should have known better than to try
the emerald door," she said; "and now shall we break the
story?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, no, no!" cried Teddy, and he was still the
hero. "Let me try once more, for it may be I can yet save the
princess."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then the Counterpane Fairy smiled. "Very well,"
she said, "you shall try again; but remember what I told you,
<i>beware of that that is little and gray</i>, and take this with
you, for it may be of use." Stooping, she picked up a blade of
grass from the ground and handed it to him.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The hero took it wondering, and in his hands it
was changed to a sword that shone so brightly that it dazzled his
eyes. Then he turned, and there was the long flight of glass
steps leading up to the golden castle just as before; so
thrusting the magic sword into his belt, he ran nimbly up and up
and up, and not until he reached the very topmost step did he
turn and look back to wave farewell to the Counterpane Fairy
below. She waved her hand to him. "Remember," she called, "beware
of what is little and gray."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He opened the door and went into the five-sided
golden hall, and there were the three doors just as before, and
the spider spinning and singing on the fourth side:</font></p>

<blockquote><font size="5">"Now the brave hero is wiser
indeed;<br>
 He may have failed once, but he still may succeed.<br>
 Dull are the emeralds; diamonds are bright;<br>
 So is his wisdom that shines as the light."</font></blockquote>

<p><font size="5">"The diamond door!" cried Teddy. "Yes, that is
the door that I should have tried. How could I have thought the
emerald door was it?" and opening the diamond door he stepped
through it.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He hardly had time to see that he was standing
at the top of the glass steps, before --br-r-r-r! --they had shut
up again into a smooth glass hill, and there he was spinning down
them so fast that the wind whistled past his ears.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">In less time than it takes to tell, he was back
again for the third time in the golden garden, with the
Counterpane Fairy standing before him, and he was ashamed to
raise his eyes.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"So!" said the Counterpane Fairy. "Did you know
no better than to open the diamond door?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"No," said Teddy, "I knew no
better."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Then," said the fairy, "if you can pay no
better heed to my warnings than that, the princess must wait for
another hero, for you are not the one."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Let me try but once more," cried Teddy, "for
this time I shall surely find her."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Then you may try once more and for the last
time," said the fairy, "but beware of what is little and gray."
Stooping she picked from the grass beside her a fallen acorn cup
and handed it to him. "Take this with you," she said, "for it may
serve you well."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As he took it from her, it was changed in his
hand to a goblet of gold set round with precious stones. He
thrust it into his bosom, for he was in haste, and turning he ran
for the third time up the flight of glass steps. This time so
eager was he that he never once paused to look back, but all the
time he ran on up and up he was wondering what it was that she
meant about her warning. She had said, "Beware of what is little
and gray." What had he seen that was little and gray?</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As soon as he reached the great golden hall he
walked over to the curtain of spider-web. The spider was spinning
so fast that it was little more than a gray streak, but presently
it stopped up in the left-hand corner of the web. As the hero
looked at it he saw that it was little and gray. Then it began to
sing to him in its little thin voice:</font></p>

<blockquote><font size="5">"Great hero, wiser than ever
before,<br>
 Try the red door, try the red door.<br>
 Open the door that is ruby, and then<br>
 You never need search for the princess
again."</font></blockquote>

<p><font size="5">"No, I will not open the ruby door," cried
Teddy. "Twice have you sent me back to the golden garden, and now
you shall fool me no more."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As he said this he saw that one corner of the
spider-web curtain was still unfinished, in spite of the spider's
haste, and underneath was something that looked like a little
yellow door. Then suddenly he knew that that was the door he must
go through. He caught hold of the curtain and pulled, but it was
as strong as steel. Quick as a flash he snatched from his belt
the magic sword, and with one blow the curtain was cut in two,
and fell at his feet.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He heard the little gray spider calling to him
in its thin voice, but he paid no heed, for he had opened the
little yellow door and stooped his head and entered.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Beyond was a great courtyard all of gold, and
with a fountain leaping and splashing back into a golden basin in
the middle. Bet what he saw first of all was the enchanted
princess, who lay stretched out as if asleep upon a couch all
covered with cloth of gold. He knew she was a princess, because
she was so beautiful and because she wore a golden
crown.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He stood looking at her without stirring, and
at last he whispered: "Princess! Princess! I have come to save
you."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Still she did not stir. He bent and touched
her, but she lay there in her enchanted sleep, and her eyes did
not open. Then Teddy looked about him, and seeing the fountain he
drew the magic cup from his bosom and, filling it, sprinkled the
hands and face of the princess with the water.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then her eyes opened and she raised herself
upon her elbow and smiled. "Have you come at last?" she
cried.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes," answered Teddy, "I have
come."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The princess looked about her. "But what became
of the spider?" she said. Then Teddy, too, looked about, and
there was the spider running across the floor toward where the
princess lay.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Quickly he sprang from her side and set his
foot upon it. There was a thin squeak and then --there was
nothing left of the little gray spinner but a tiny gray smudge on
the floor.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Instantly the golden castle was shaken from top
to bottom, and there was a sound of many voices shouting outside.
The princess rose to her feet and caught the hero by the hand.
"You have broken the enchantment," she cried, "and now you shall
be the King of the Golden Castle and reign with me."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, but I can't," said Teddy, "because
--because---"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">But the princess drew him out with her through
the hall, and there they were at the head of the flight of glass
steps. A great host of soldiers and courtiers were running up it.
They were dressed in cloth of gold, and they shouted at the sight
of Teddy: "Hail to the hero! Hail to the hero!" and Teddy knew
them by their voices for the golden birds that had fluttered
around him in the garden below.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"And all this is yours," said the beautiful
princess, turning toward him with---</font></p>

<center><font size="5">* * * * * * * *</font></center>

<p><font size="5">"So that is the story of the yellow square,"
said the Counterpane Fairy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy looked about him. The golden castle was
gone, and the stairs, and the shouting courtiers. He was lying in
bed with the silk coverlet over his little knees and Hannah was
still singing in the kitchen below.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Did you like it?" asked the fairy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy heaved a deep sigh. "Oh! Wasn't it
beautiful?" he said. Then he lay for a while thinking and
smiling. "Wasn't the princess lovely?" he whispered half to
himself.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The Counterpane Fairy got up slowly and
stiffly, and picked up the staff that she had laid down beside
her. "Well, I must be journeying on," she said.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, no, no!" cried Teddy. "Please don't go
yet."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, I must," said the Counterpane Fairy. "I
hear your mother coming."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"But will you come back again?" cried
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The Counterpane Fairy made no answer. She was
walking down the other side of the bedquilt hill, and Teddy heard
her voice, little and thin, dying away in the distance: "Oh dear,
dear, dear! What a hill to go down! What a hill it is! Oh dear,
dear, dear!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then the door opened and his mother came in.
She was looking rested, and she smiled at him lovingly, but the
little brown Counterpane Fairy was gone.</font></p>
