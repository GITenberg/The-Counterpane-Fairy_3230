<p><font size="5">HE next day Teddy was allowed to go about and
follow mamma into the sewing-room, where he had the little
cutting-table drawn out and his toys put on it, and played for a
long time.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">In the afternoon Harriett stopped for a little
while, and as soon as Teddy saw her his thoughts went back to the
Counterpane Fairy and the story, and he cried out: "Oh, Harriett!
I know what you dreamed last night."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"What did I dream?" asked Harriett.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Why, you dreamed about the soap-bubbles and
me; didn't you?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"How did you know I dreamed that?" asked
Harriett.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then Teddy told her all about standing by the
lake and seeing the dreams go past, and how he had shut the ugly
one up in the toy-closet.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Harriett listened with great interest. "Wasn't
that a funny dream?" she cried when he had ended.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"A dream!" said Teddy. "Why, that wasn't a
dream, Harriett. That's the story the Counterpane Fairy showed
me. And don't you know you <i>did</i> dream about the
bubbles?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Harriet was silent awhile as if pondering it,
and then she said, "My canary-bird flew away this
morning."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Who let it out?" asked Teddy, with interest.
"Did you?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Harriett hesitated. "Well, I didn't exactly let
it out," she said. "I guess I forgot to close the door after I
cleaned its cage." Then she added hastily: "But mamma hung the
cage outside the window, and she says she thinks maybe it'll come
back unless someone has caught it."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy wanted to hear a great deal more about
the canary, but Harriett said she must go now, so he was left
alone again to play with his toys.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After dinner his mother went down-town to buy a
present for Harriett, for the next day was to be the little
girl's birthday. Teddy wanted to get her a bag of marbles, but
she thought perhaps she would be able to find something Harriett
would like better than that. She would look about and
see.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Before she went she made Teddy lie down on the
bed, and covered him over with the silk quilt, so that he might
rest for a while. Then she kissed him and told him to try to take
a nap, and promised to be back soon.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After she had gone Teddy dozed comfortably for
a while. Then he grew wide awake again, and turning over on his
back he raised his knees into a hill, and lay looking out of the
window, and wondering when mamma would come home, and what she
would bring with her.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"You're not asleep, are you?' asked a little
voice from his knees.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, Counterpane Fairy, I'm so glad you've
come," cried Teddy, "for mamma has gone down-town, and I was just
beginning to get lonely."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">There was the familiar little figure in the
brown cloak and hood, seated on top of the counterpane hill, and
as he spoke she looked down on him smilingly. "I suppose the next
thing will be a story," she said.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh! will you show me one?" cried Teddy. "I
wish you would, for I don't know when mamma will be
home."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Very well," said the fairy. "Perhaps I can
show you one before she comes back. Which square shall it be this
time?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I've had the red, and the yellow, and the
green, and ever so many: I wonder if that brown one has a good
story to it."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"You might choose it and see," said the fairy.
So Teddy chose that one, and then the fairy began to count. "One,
two, three, four, five," she counted, and so on and on until she
reached "FORTY-NINE!"</font></p>

<center><font size="5">* * * * * * * *</font></center>

<p><font size="5">"Why, how funny!" cried Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He was nowhere at all but on the back
door-step, and he sat there just as naturally as though he were
not in a story at all. Then the back gate opened, and in through
it came a little withered old woman, wearing a brown cloak, and a
brown hood drawn over her head. "Why, Counterpane Fairy!" cried
Teddy, but when she raised her head and looked at him he saw that
it was not the Counterpane Fairy after all, but an old Italian
woman carrying a basket on her arm.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"You buy something, leetle boy?" she
said.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I can't," said Teddy. "I haven't any money
except what's in my bank, but I'll ask Hannah and maybe she
will."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">So saying he ran into the kitchen. The clock
was ticking on the wall, and the room smelled of fresh-baked
bread, but it was empty. Opening the door of the stairway, Teddy
called, "Hannah! Hannah!" There was no answer; it all seemed
strangely still upstairs. "She must have gone out," Teddy said to
himself.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">When he went back to the outside door the old
Italian had put down her basket and was sitting on the step
beside it. She did not seem at all surprised when he told her he
could not find anyone. "You not find anyone, and you not have
money," she said. "Then I tell you what I do; you put your hand
in dis baskit, and I give you what you take; I make what you call
'present.'"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Will you really?" cried Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yis," said the little old woman, smiling, and
her smile was just like the smile of the Counterpane
Fairy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"And you'll give me whatever I
take?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yis," said the little old woman
again.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy put his hand in under the cover and
caught hold of something hard and cold. He pulled and pulled at
it, and out it came; it was a little iron shovel.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"You take something more," said the little old
woman. Teddy hesitated, but when he looked at her again he saw
that she really meant it, so he put his hand in and this time he
pulled out a large iron key.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Now try once more," said the little old woman,
and this third time it was a rat-trap baited with cheese, that
Teddy drew from the basket.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"But what shall I do with them?" he
asked.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"You keep dem," said the old Italian, "and you
find you need dem by and by." Then she rose, and pulling her
cloak over the basket she took her staff in her other hand and
hobbled down the pathway.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy slipped the key into his pocket, and
holding the shovel and the trap he ran down to the gate to open
it for her. He stood looking after her as she went on down the
street, her staff striking the bricks sharply, tap! tap! tap! Her
back was certainly exactly like the Counterpane
Fairy's.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As he walked slowly up the path swinging his
shovel by the handle, he noticed that there was a rat-hole just
back of the rain-butt, and he thought what fun it would be to dig
it out, so he put the cage down on the ground and set to work
with his shovel.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The earth broke away from the rat-hole in great
clods, and he found it so easy to dig that very soon he had made
quite a big hole.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then he saw that down in this hole there was a
flight of stone steps leading into the earth. "Why, isn't that
funny!" said Teddy. "Right in the back yard, too. I wonder where
they go!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Tucking the shovel under his arm and taking the
trap in his hand, Teddy stepped into the rat-hole and began to go
down the stairs.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He went on down and down and down, and at last
he came to an iron door, and it was locked. Teddy tried it and
knocked, but there was no answer. He listened with his ear
against it, but he heard nothing, and he was just about to turn
and go up the stairs again, when he remembered the key the little
old woman had given him.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He pulled it out of his pocket, and when he
tried it in the keyhole it fitted exactly. He turned it, the door
flew open, and Teddy stepped through.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Beyond was a cave, just such as he had often
wished he could live in, with a rough table and chair, old kegs,
and a heap of rubbish in one corner. On each side of the cave was
a heavy door studded with iron nails. "I will just see where
these doors lead to," said Teddy to himself, laying his trap and
his shovel behind one of the kegs.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As he reached the first door and put his hand
on it he heard someone singing the other side of it as sweetly
and clearly as a bird, and this is what the voice
sang:</font></p>

<blockquote><font size="5">"In field and meadow the grasses
grow;<br>
 The clouds are white and the winds they blow.<br>
 Out in the world there is much to see,<br>
 If I were but free! If I were but free!</font>
<p><font size="5">My wings were bright and my wings were
strong;<br>
 I plumed myself and I sang a song:<br>
 Where is the hero to rescue me,<br>
 And set me free? And set me free?"</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="5">The song ended and Teddy opened the
door.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Within was another room that looked almost like
the first, only there was a fireplace in it, and in front of this
fireplace a young girl was sitting.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As soon as Teddy opened the door she looked
over her shoulder, and when she saw him she sprang to her feet
with a glad cry and clasped her hands. "Oh!" she cried, "have you
come to rescue me?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Who are you?" asked Teddy, wondering at
her.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">She was very beautiful. Her eyes were as bright
and black as a sloe, her hair shone like threads of pure gold,
and she wore a long cloak of golden feathers over her
shoulders.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">When Teddy spoke she answered him, "I am Avis,
the Bird-maiden."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"And how did you come here?" asked
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then the Bird-maiden told him how she used to
live in a golden castle that was all her own; how she ate from
crystal dishes and bathed every morning in a little marble
bath-tub, and had nothing to do all day but swing in her golden
swing and sing for her own pleasure. But after a while she grew
tired of all this and began to wonder what the outside world was
like, and one the day the sun was so bright and the air so sweet
that she left her home and flew out into the wide, wide
world.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">That was all very pleasant until she grew tired
and sat down on a stone to rest. Then a great brown robber came
and caught her and carried her down into his den, and there he
kept her a prisoner in spite of her tears and prayers, and there
she must wait on him and keep his house in order; every day he
went out and left her along, coming back loaded down with food or
golden treasure that he had stolen.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"But why don't you run away?" asked Teddy. "I
would."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Alas! I can't," said the Bird-maiden, "for
whenever the robber-magician goes out he locks the door after
him, and I have no key to open it."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then Teddy told her that he had a key that
would unlock the door and that he would save her.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The Bird-maiden was very glad, but she said
they must make haste, for it was almost time for the robber to
come home; so she wrapped her cloak around her, and Teddy took
her by the hand and together they ran to the door.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">They had hardly reached the outer cave,
however, when Teddy heard a loud bang that echoed and re-echoed
from the walls.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Alas! Alas!" cried the Bird-maiden, shrinking
back and beginning to wring her hands, "we are too late. There
comes the robber, and now we will never escape."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">She had scarcely said this when in marched the
robber-magician sure enough. He wore a great soft hat pulled down
over his face, and he had a long brown nose and little black
beads of eyes. His mustache stuck out on each side like swords,
and he carried a great sack over his shoulder.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The robber-magician threw the sack down on the
floor and frowned at Teddy from under his hat. "How now!" he
cried. "Who's this who has come down into my cavern without even
so much as a 'by your leave'?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy felt rather frightened, but he spoke up
bravely. "I'm Teddy," he said, "and I didn't know this was your
cave. I thought it was just a rat-hole."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"A rat-hole!" cried the robber-magician,
bursting into a roar of laughter. "A rat-hole! My cave a
rat-hole! Ho! ho! ho!'</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, I did," said Teddy, "and I didn't know it
was yours, but if you want me to go I will."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Not so fast," said the robber. "Sometimes it
is easier to come into my cave than to go out, and you must sit
down and have some supper with me now that you are
here."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy was quite willing to do that, for he was
really hungry, so he and the robber drew chairs up to the table,
and the Bird-maiden, at a gesture from the robber, picked up the
sack that he had thrown upon the ground, and out from it she drew
some pieces of bread and some bits of cold meat. It did not look
particularly good, but it seemed to be all there was, so when the
robber began to eat Teddy helped himself too.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The robber-magician did not take off his hat,
and he ate very fast; after a while he leaned back in his chair
and began to tell Teddy what a great magician he was, and about
his treasure chamber.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"There," he said, "is where I keep my gold. I
have gold, and gold, and gold, great bars and lumps and crusts of
gold, all piled up in my treasure chamber." At last he rose,
pushed back his chair, and bade Teddy follow him and he should
see how great and rich he was.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Leading the way across the cave, he unlocked
the third door, and flinging it open stepped back so that Teddy
might look in. As he opened it a very curious smell came
out.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy stared and stared about the treasure
chamber. "But where is the gold?" he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"There, right before your eyes," said the
robber. "Don't you see it?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Why, that isn't gold. That's nothing but
cheese," cried Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Cheese! cheese!" cried the robber-magician,
stamping his foot in a rage; "I tell you it's gold."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"It isn't! it's cheese!" said Teddy. "Look! I
have some just like it; I'll show you," and running to the keg
where he had left his trap he pulled it out and held it up for
the robber to see.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As soon as the robber-magician saw the cheese
in the trap his fingers began to work and his mouth to water.
"Oh, what a fine rich piece of gold!" he cried. "How do you get
it out?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I don't know," said Teddy. "I don't think it
comes out."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"There must be some way," cried the robber.
"Let me see," and taking the trap from Teddy he put it down on
the floor and began to pick and pry at the bars, but he could not
get the cheese out, and the more he tried the more eager he grew.
"There's one way," he muttered to himself, looking up at Teddy
suspiciously from under his slouch hat.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"How is that?' asked Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"If one were only a rat one could get at it
fast enough," said the robber-magician.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, but you're not," said Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"All the same it might be managed," said the
magician. Again he tore and tore at the bars, and he grew so
eager that he seemed to forget about everything but the cheese.
"I'll do it," he cried, "yes, I will." Then he laid of his great
soft hat, and crossing his forefingers he cried:</font></p>

<blockquote><font size="5">"Innocent me! Innocent me!<br>
 As I was once again I will be."</font></blockquote>

<p><font size="5">And now the magician's nose grew longer, his
mustache grew thin and stiff like whiskers, his sword changed to
a long tail, and in a minute he was nothing at all but a great
brown rat that ran into the trap.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Click!" went the trap, and there he was
fastened in with the cheese.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">It was in vain that he shook the bars and
squeaked.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Quick! quick!" cried the Bird-maiden, "let us
escape before he can use his spells." She caught Teddy by the
hand, and together they ran to the door that led to the stairway.
"Your key! Oh, make haste!" cried the Bird-maiden,
breathlessly.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">In a moment Teddy had unlocked the door they
had passed through, and it had swung to behind them. Up the
stairs they ran, and there they were standing in the sunlight
near the rain-butt.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I am free! I am free!" cried the Bird-maiden,
joyously. "Oh! thank you, little boy. And now for home." She
caught the edges of her cloak and spread it wide, and as she did
so it changed to wings, her head grew round and covered with
feathers, and with a glad cry she sprang from the earth and flew
up and away and out of sight through the sunlight.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Why, it's Harriett's canary!" cried
Teddy.</font></p>

<center><font size="5">* * * * * * * *</font></center>

<p><font size="5">"And now I must go," said the Counterpane
Fairy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy was back in the India-room. The sun was
low, and a broad band of pale sunlight lay across the foot of the
bed. The fairy was just starting down the counterpane
hill.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Was it really Harriett's canary?" asked
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I haven't time to talk of that now," cried the
Counterpane Fairy, "for I hear your mother coming. Good-bye!
good-bye!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">And sure enough she had scarcely disappeared
behind the counterpane hill when his mamma came in.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, Mamma!" cried Teddy, "do you think
Harriett's canary came back?</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I don't know, dear," said his mother. Then she
put a little package into his hand. "Do you think Harriett will
like that?" she asked.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">When Teddy opened the bundle he saw a cunning
little bisque doll that sat in a little tin bath-tub. You could
take the doll out and dress it, or you could really bathe it in
the tub.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh! isn't that cute!" cried Teddy, with
delight. "Won't little Cousin Harriett be pleased!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I hope she will," said mamma.</font></p>
