<p><font size="5">IS' THOMAS, Ann McFinney's downstairs to see
you about that sewing you said she could do for you," said
Hannah, putting her head in at the door. Mamma was sitting close
to the bed playing a game of Old Maid with Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Very well, Hannah; tell her I'll be there in a
moment," she said.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, please don't go yet," said Teddy. "It's my
draw. Match! You're the old maid. Oh, Mamma! You're an old maid!"
And he pointed his finger at her and laughed.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Why, so I am," said mamma. "Now you can
shuffle the cards, and when I come back we'll have another
game."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Don't stay long," begged Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I'll come back as soon as I can," said mamma,
and then she went out.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy lay propped up on the pillow and shuffled
and shuffled the cards, and wished his mother would hurry. He did
not like Ann McFinney, for when she came she always cried, and
wiped her eyes on the corner of her apron, and told how her
husband was out of work, and the children needed
shoes.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Now it was some time before mamma came back,
and when she did she had her bonnet on. "Darling," she said, "I
have to go out for a while. Mrs. McFinney's baby's sick, and I've
promised the poor thing to come over and see it. I won't be gone
long, and when I come back I'll bring you a sheet of paper
soldiers to cut out."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I'd rather have a paper circus," said
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Very well," said mamma, "I'll bring you a
circus instead." Then she gave him some picture-books to look at
while she was out, and kissed him good-bye, telling him to be a
good boy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">She went out through the next room, and he
heard her pause to wind the music-box and set it playing.
"There," she called back to him, "you'll have the music to keep
you company," and then she went on down-stairs.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After she had gone Teddy lay fingering the
books and not caring to open them, he knew them so well. "Oh
dear!" he sighed, "I wish the Counterpane Fairy was
here!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh dear, dear, dear! How steep this hill is!"
said a little voice just back of his knees. "Don't break, me
little staff, or down I'll go, head over heels to the bottom."
Teddy knew the voice well, and his heart gave a leap of pleasure.
There was the pointed cap and the withered face of the
Counterpane Fairy just appearing above the counterpane
hill.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, Mrs. Fairy, I'm so glad you came, and I
have the loveliest square picked out!" cried Teddy. "I hadn't
seen it before, because it was the other side of my knees. It's
that white one with the silver leaves on it, and my mamma says it
was a scrap left from her wedding dress."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Wait, wait," said the fairy, "till a body gets
her breath. Now which one is it?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"It's that one," said Teddy. "Will you tell me
about it?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Why, yes," said the fairy, "if that's the one
you want. Now fix your eyes on it while I count."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then the Counterpane Fairy began to count. He
heard her voice going on and on and on. "FORTY-NINE!" she
cried.</font></p>

<center><font size="5">* * * * * * *</font></center>

<p><font size="5">When Teddy looked about him he saw that he was
standing in a long hall of white marble veined with silver. There
were arches and pillars of silver and all the walls were carved
with lilies.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy walked slowly down this hall, and as he
walked a rosy glow seemed to move with him. He looked down to see
what made it, and found that he was dressed in a tunic of
rose-colored silk, such as he had never seen before, and it was
fastened about the waist with a golden girdle. His feet were
bare, but the air was so mildly warm that the marble did not
chill him.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After a while, as he walked slowly and
wonderingly down the hall, he turned a corner and found himself
in another hall just like the first, only at one side there was a
great crystal window, and sitting on a marble seat before it was
the Counterpane Fairy herself. She sat quite still as though she
were listening, and she paid no attention to Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He was sure it must be the Counterpane Fairy,
for it looked like her, though she was quite large now; she
looked as large as a real woman.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy stood looking at her for a while, and
waiting for her to see him, but she paid no attention, and so at
last he whispered, "Counterpane Fairy!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Hush!" said she. "I'm listening."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then Teddy listened too, and as soon as he did
he heard a sound of music like that of the music-box in the
nursery at home, only it was very much clearer, and sweeter, and
fainter.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">It seemed to come from outside the crystal
window, and looking through it Teddy saw that outside was the
most beautiful garden he had ever seen. The grass of the garden
was a silvery green; and the paths were white. The leaves of the
tress were lined with silver, and the branches hung with shining
fruit. There were lilies growing beside the paths, and in the
centre of the garden a fountain leaped and fell back into a
marble basin. The water sparkled as though it were made of
diamonds, and as Teddy listened he knew that the music he heard
was the voice of the fountain.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Presently it ceased and then the fairy turned
to him and smiled.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, Counterpane Fairy!" cried Teddy, "may I go
out into that garden?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"That I don't know," said the fairy, "but if
you want to get there the best thing for you to do is find
Starlein and Silverling, for they are the only ones who can show
you the way into the garden."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Where are they?" asked Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I can't tell you that, either," said the
fairy, "but they're somewhere in the halls."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I'll go find them," cried Teddy, and without
waiting any longer he turned and ran down the hall as fast as he
could, he was in such haste to find them and get them to show him
the way into the garden.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">On and on he ran, through one hall after
another, through arched doorways, and along echoing corridors,
until he felt all bewildered and out of breath. All the time he
was running he seemed to hear the music of the singing fountain
in his ears, but whenever he stopped to listen everything was
still.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He was so out of breath that he had begun to
walk, when turning another corner he suddenly saw before him a
little girl who he somehow felt sure was Starlein.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Her hair was of a silvery yellow and was like a
mist about her head; she was very beautiful and was dressed from
head to foot in silver that shone and sparkled as she moved.
Around her was flying a flock of white doves, and she was playing
with them and talking.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As soon as she saw Teddy she cried out, "Oh,
it's a little child!" and running down the hall to him, with her
doves flying about her, she put her little hands on his cheeks
and kissed him. Then she stood back and looked at him with her
hands clasped. "You dear little boy!" she said. "Where did you
come from?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I came through the white square," said
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I don't know the white square," said the
little girl, "but I'm glad you came. I haven't anyone to play
with since Silverling went away."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Where has Silverling gone?" asked Teddy. "I
must find him."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The little girl shook her head. "I don't know,"
she said. "We quarrelled once and he went away. He must be in
some of the halls, but I've been hunting and hunting ever since
and I can't find him."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then Teddy told her how the Counterpane Fairy
had said that he must find Silverling and Starlein and that then
perhaps he could get into the garden where the singing fountain
was.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The little girl shook her head again. "I am
Starlein," she said, "but I can't take you into the garden,
because I have never found the gate into it since Silverling went
away," and she went over and sat down on a marble bench beside
the wall, and all the doves settled about her on her knees and
shoulders.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Never mind," cried Teddy, bravely, "you wait
here and I'll go and find him. I found you and I'll find him
too."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Turning he ran down the hall and through an
arched way into another hall, and there, far, far down at the
other end, he saw a little boy dressed in silver, who was tossing
a silver ball up into the air and catching it again.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">When he saw Teddy he slipped the ball into his
pocket and ran to meet him, leaping with delight and clapping his
hands. "Oh, little boy! little boy!" he cried, "will you come and
play with me?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Are you Silverling?" cried Teddy,
breathlessly.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes," said the little boy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Then come! come quick!" cried Teddy. "Starlein
is just around the corner, and she is waiting for you to come and
show us the way into the garden where the singing fountain
is."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He caught Silverling by the hand and without
another word they ran as fast as they could up the hall and
around the corner, through the silvery archway, and into the
other hall. There Teddy stopped short, looking blankly about him.
Starlein was gone.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Silverling shook his head sadly. "I know how it
would be," he said. "I've been hunting for her ever since we
quarrelled, but I can't find her, and I can't find the way into
the garden of the singing fountain either."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"What did you quarrel about?" asked
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"We quarrelled about this," said the little
boy, touching a slender golden chain that hung around his neck.
"We found it in the garden and we quarrelled about who should
wear it, but I'd be so glad to give it to Starlein now if she
would only come back again."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well, wait!" said Teddy. "She can't be far
away and I'll go and find her."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"No, no!" cried Silverling. "You can't find
her, and I'll lose you too. Stay here awhile, little boy, and
play with me, for I'm very lonely. Look! Let's play with my
silver ball," and taking it from his pocket he tossed it to
Teddy. Teddy caught it and threw it back to him, and so they
played together in the marble hall, tossing the silver ball and
shouting with laughter.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">At last Silverling missed the ball, and as it
rolled on down the hall he ran after it, stooping and trying to
catch it, but always just missing. Teddy shouted and clapped his
hands, jumping up and down with his bare feet, and then he stood
still watching Silverling as he ran far, far down the
hall.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As he stood thus, suddenly he heard from just
around the corner the cooing of Starlein's doves.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He did not stop a moment, but turning ran
around into the next hall, and there sure enough was Starlein
with her doves about her.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, little boy!" she cried, "I was afraid I
had lost you."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">But Teddy caught her by the hand. "Come quick!"
he cried, "I have found Silverling."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">They ran together into the hall where a moment
ago Silverling had been playing with the silver ball, but it was
vacant now; Silverling was gone.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well, I never!" said Teddy. Then he turned to
Starlein. "Starlein, you shouldn't have gone away when I told you
not to."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I didn't," said Starlein. "I stayed right
there."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy thought awhile. "Then it must have been
the wrong hall," he said. "But never mind! I'll find him again,
and this time I'll surely bring him to you; only wait here no
matter how long it is."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Stop! oh, stop!" cried Starlein. She caught
one of her doves in her hands and held it out to Teddy. "Here,
little boy," she said; "take this with you, and if you can't find
me again, give it to Silverling and tell him he is to keep it for
his very own."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, I will," said Teddy, and he took the dove
and put it in the bosom of his tunic, and it nestled there all
warm and soft and still.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then he turned and walked quietly down the hall
and into another. He went on and on, but he did not run and jump
now, for he was thinking. After a while, when he turned into
another hall he once more saw Silverling at play with his silver
ball.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Did you find her?" cried Silverling,
eagerly.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes," said Teddy, "I found her, and she sent
you a dove for your very own; but, Silverling, I think this. I
think the only way for us ever to find her together is for us to
set the dove free, and to follow it when it flies back to
her."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"But we couldn't follow it," said Silverling.
"It would fly so fast that it would be out of sight in a
minute."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I know," said Teddy, "but we could tie
something to it."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"What could we fasten to it?" asked
Silverling.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The two little boys stood looking about them
and wondering what they could use. Suddenly Teddy clapped his
hands so the dove in his tunic started. "We'll fasten the end of
your golden chain to it," he cried.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">No sooner said than done. In a moment
Silverling had taken the chain from his neck and unfastened the
ends. It was so long that it had been twisted several times
around his neck. Very gently they took the dove and fastened the
chain to its leg, and then they let it go.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">It fluttered up over their heads and circled
about them once or twice, and then it flew on down the hall with
the little boys following it.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">They turned many a corner and went through many
a door, and at last they came into a hall and there --there was
Starlein waiting for them with her doves about her.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, Starlein!" cried Silverling.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, Silverling!" cried Starlein.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">They ran to each other and threw their arms
about each other's necks and kissed, while the white doves flew
circling about them. Then they told each other how sorry they
were that they had quarrelled, and that they would never do it
any more, and then they kissed again.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"And you may have the golden chain, Starlein,"
said Silverling.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"No, no! you must keep it," said
Starlein.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, I know what we'll do!" cried Silverling;
"we'll give it to this little boy, because if it hadn't been for
him we wouldn't have found each other."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, yes!" said Starlein.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">But Teddy held up his hand-- "Hush!" he
whispered; "don't you hear it?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then they all listened, and sweeter and clearer
than ever before they heard the voice of the singing fountain in
the beautiful garden.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"It is the fountain!" cried Starlein and
Silverling, half fearfully.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">They each caught Teddy by the hand, and all ran
down the hall together, and the very first corner that they
turned they found themselves at the door of the
garden.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The wind was blowing the lilies, the fruit on
the wonderful trees shone and glistened in the sunlight, and the
fountain --ah! the fountain was no longer singing, for the
music-box in the nursery had run down.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy looked about him. Instead of the garden
there was the flowery India-room. The clock ticked, the fire
crackled; --he was back in bed once more, and he heard mamma
speaking to Hannah in the hall outside, so he knew she was home
again.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"And that is the end of that story," said the
Fairy of the Counterpane.</font></p>
