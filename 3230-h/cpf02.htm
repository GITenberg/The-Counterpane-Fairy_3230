<p><font size="5">HE next morning when Teddy awoke it was still
very early; so early that even Hannah was not yet
stirring.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Outside everything was wrapped in a silvery
mist, and now and then a drop of moisture plumped down on the
porch roof.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy lay still for a while, growing wider and
wider awake, and then he began to stir restlessly and wish that
his mother would come. After a while he called her, but the house
was so silent that he didn't like to call very loudly, and there
was no answer.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He thought he would call again, and then
suddenly he remembered the Counterpane Fairy, and wondered if she
would like little boys who called their mothers so
early.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He turned over in bed, and raising his knees
into a hill stared at the yellow silk square and thought of the
wonderful golden castle where she had taken him the day before.
He wished he knew what all the bird people would have done when
they reached the top of the stairs. He thought they would have
put a golden crown on his head and made him king.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">And the princess was so beautiful he longed to
see her again. How surprised Hannah would have been if she had
heard voices, and had come up-stairs to see who it was, and had
found the beautiful princess sitting with him, and had seen the
golden crown on his head! If she only knew about it she would
never call him a mischievous boy again. He had done a great deal
more than Hannah could.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh dear, oh dear!" said a little voice just
back of his knees; "almost at the top, anyway." Teddy knew the
voice; it was that of the Counterpane Fairy, and there was the
top of her brown hood showing over his knees. He watched,
breathless with eagerness, until he saw her face appear above
them, and then he cried out: "I wondered whether you would come;
I'm so glad. Are you going to show me another story, and will you
stay a long while?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The Counterpane Fairy said nothing until she
had sat down on top of his knees for a while and caught her
breath, and then she said: "Well, <i>well!</i> It's steeper than
it was yesterday. I thought I should never get across that satin
square, it was so slippery."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Shall I put my knees down?" asked Teddy,
moving them.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"For mercy's sake! no," said the fairy,
clutching at the quilt. "You might upset me. Keep right still and
I'll show you another story."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, yes!" cried Teddy; "please do; and let me
go to the golden castle again."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"No, I can't do that," said the Counterpane
Fairy, "for that was yesterday's story, and this will be
another."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"But what became of the princess?" asked
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh! she married the hero, of course," said the
fairy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"But I thought <i>I</i> was the
hero."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"There, there!" said the fairy, impatiently, "I
told you that was yesterday's story, and if you want to see any
more you must choose another square."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well, I will," said Teddy. "May I choose that
green square?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes," said the fairy. "Now fix your eyes on it
while I count."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy began to stare at the green square so
hard that he scarcely winked, but he heard the Counterpane Fairy
counting on in her thin little voice until she reached
FORTY-NINE.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The green square spread and grew just as the
yellow one had done while she counted, until Teddy seemed
drifting off into endless green spaces. Then the Counterpane
Fairy clapped her hands and he saw that he was hovering over a
grassy hillside.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Now you are an elf, you know," he heard the
fairy say.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">At the bottom of the green hill there was a
brook, and at the top was a line of shady green woods. Overhead
the sky was very blue, with shining heaps of cottony white
clouds; a soft wind was blowing, but the sun was warm, and
insects were buzzing past intent on business. A brown bird
whirred by and dropped out of sight among the grasses.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy floated through the air lighter than a
feather, and he felt so happy that he clapped his hands together
and turned head over heels in the air. As he came right side up
again he saw a bit of thistle-down drifting on up the hill, and
he was so little that when he flew after it and set himself
astride of it, it seemed as big as a barrel to him. He floated on
up the hill with it, and the wind was like a cushion behind
him.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As they reached the edge of the hill the
thistle-down caught on a bush, and Teddy almost has his leg
wedged between it and a leaf. He jumped off in a hurry, and stood
looking about him and wondering what he should do
next.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Suddenly he saw something that made him open
his eyes wide in astonishment. Four large black-and-yellow
butterflies were tied to a knot on an old tree close by, but it
was not at the butterflies themselves that he wondered, for he
had often seen them flitting about the fields; it was at the way
they were loaded down with the strangest things: all sorts of
fairy household furniture --little chairs and tables, bedsteads,
tiny pots and pans, a great soup-kettle almost as large as a
huckleberry, two thistle-down mattresses, and a number of other
things. All these were very neatly packed and tied between the
butterflies' wings with spider-web ropes.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">In the middle of the knot was a hole, but
instead of being round, as a knot-hole generally is, it was
square, and there was a little door fitted into it.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Suddenly this door opened, and on the threshold
of it stood a beautiful little fairy. She stood there looking
about, and then she drew from her pocket a handkerchief, thin and
delicate as gossamer, and wiped her eyes. After that she began to
sob, and Teddy knew that what he had thought was the buzzing of a
bee inside the knot had really been the sound of her
weeping.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Hello!" called the elf.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The fairy stopped sobbing and looked about her.
When she saw Teddy she stared at him for a moment and then she
began to wipe her eyes and sob again.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy climbed up the branch of a blackberry
bush until he was quite close to the knot-hole, and sat down on
the stem and stared at her. "What makes you cry?" he
asked.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Still the fairy said nothing, but she folded
her little handkerchief, though it was quite wet, and put it
carefully back into her pocket.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Just then in the doorway at her side appeared
another fairy. He was quite different from her, though he, too,
was very small. He was as withered as a dried pea, and looked as
though he must be at least a hundred years old.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Is everything packed up?" he asked in a
querulous voice. Then his eyes fell on Teddy the elf. He scowled
until his little pin-pricks of eyes almost disappeared. "Ugh!
there's one of those nasty gamblesome elves," he said. "Now
mischief's sure to follow."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I'm not a gamblesome elf!" cried
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes you are!" said the withered old fairy.
"You needn't tell me! Look at your red cap and the way your toes
turn down. I say you are a gamblesome elf."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy looked at his toes and sure enough they
did turn down. "I wonder if I am a gamblesome elf," he
thought.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">But the old fairy paid no more attention to
him. He seemed to be in a great hurry and very cross. He bustled
in and out of the knot-hole, bringing a broom and an old coat
that had been forgotten, and packed them on the butterflies, and
then he helped the lady fairy on to one, and clambered on another
himself.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After they were all ready to start he found
that he had forgotten to unhitch the butterflies, and grumbling
and scolding he clambered down again and untied them. Then he
climbed back once more, and away they flew down the hillside and
out of sight, the lady fairy weeping all the time as though her
heart would break.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I wonder what she was crying about," said the
gamblesome elf to himself, as he stared after them.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I can tell you that easily enough," said a
little voice so close to his elbow that it made him
jump.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He looked around and saw close to him a brown
beetle, sitting on a blackberry leaf. Teddy looked at the beetle
for a while in silence, and then he said, "Well, why is it
they're going?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"It's all because of old Mrs. Owl," said the
beetle. "She and old Father Owl used to live deep in the woods in
a hollow tree, but one time they determined to move out to the
edge of the hill, because the air was better, and what tree
should they choose for their home but this very one where
Granddaddy Thistletop has been living as long as I can remember.
Then when the owls were all settled they began to complain. They
said that Granddaddy Thistletop and Rosine were so noisy all day
that they couldn't sleep.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"After the little owls hatched out it was worse
than ever, for the old mother said that every time Rosine cooked
the dinner it made the little owls sneeze, and so the fairies
must go."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I wouldn't have gone," cried Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, yes you would," said the beetle. "The owls
could have stopped up the doors and windows, or they could
--well, they could have done almost anything, they're so big. You
may go in and look at the house, if you want to. I have to go
down the bush and see old Mrs. Ant. Good-bye! I'll see you again
after a while."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">When the beetle had gone, Teddy climbed up to
the knot-hole and went in. There was a long entry as narrow and
dark as a mouse-hole, and with doors opening off from it here and
there. At the end of the hall was a room that must have been the
kitchen. It was very bare and lonely now, and there was a
fireplace at one end with a streak of light shining down through
the chimney.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">While Teddy was standing by the chimney, he
heard a rustling and stirring about overhead; one of the little
owls clicked its beak in its sleep, and he heard a sleepy,
whining voice: "Now just you stop scrouging me. Screecher is
scrouging me!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then he heard the Mother Owl: "Hus-s-s-h!
Hus-s-s-h! Go to sleep; it's broad daylight yet." After that all
was still again.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I wish," thought Teddy to himself, "that I
could do something to make the owls go away." Then he began to
giggle to himself, and put both hands over his mouth so that the
owls up above wouldn't hear him.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He tiptoed back to the door in the knot-hole,
and looked down at a bush with long thorns on it, that grew close
by. "I'll do it," he said to himself; "I'll break off the thorns
and put them in the nest, so that the owls just can't stay
there." In a moment he was down on the bush and tugging at a
tough thorn.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As soon as it broke off, he lifted it on his
shoulder and clambered up the rough bark of the tree to the great
black hole where the owls lived. When he looked down into it,
there they were in the nest, fluffy and gray, and fast asleep.
Very quietly he slipped down, and set the thorn in the side of
the nest, with the point sticking out. After that, he softly
clambered out again.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Up and down, up and down the tree he climbed
again and again, carrying thorns and quietly setting them in the
nest, and as he went up and down he kept whispering to himself:
"I'm a gamblesome elf; oh, yes, indeed I <i>am</i> a gamblesome
elf."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After he thought he had put enough in the nest,
he went into old Granddaddy Thistletop's kitchen, and, crouching
down by the fireplace, he listened. It was getting to be twilight
now, and the owls were beginning to stir. Presently he heard a
voice cry out: "Ouch! Flipperty is sticking his toes into
me."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"No I ain't, neither," said another voice.
"It's Pinny-winny. There, she's doing it to me, too. Now just you
stop."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"'Tain't me," cried a little squeaky voice;
"it's Screecher hisself. Ow! Ow! I'm going to tell," and she
began to cry.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"You naughty little owls," cried the Mother
Owl's voice, "what do you mean by digging your little
sister?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I didn't," cried Screecher and Flipperty,
together. "Ouch! Ouch! There's something sharp in the
nest."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"My dear," said old Father Owl's voice from the
branch outside, "can't you keep those children quiet?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Quiet indeed!" cried old Mother Owl. "Here is
the nest all set full of thorns, and you expect them to be quiet.
No wonder the poor children make a noise. Just you come here and
help me get the thorns out."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Thorns!" cried Father Owl. "How did they get
in there?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"That's more than I can tell," said the Mother
Owl. "Perhaps it's old Granddaddy Thistletop's doings. I thought
those fairies had gone away, but they must be down there still.
I'll just fly down and see, and if they are, I'll make them sorry
enough."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">With that, down flew the Mother Owl, and
putting one big yellow eye at the kitchen window, she looked in.
"Who-o-o! you fairies," she cried, "are you in there
still?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">At first, her eye looked so very big and yellow
that Teddy was frightened. Then he remembered that he was a
gamblesome elf, so he made a face at her, and began to hop up and
down and twirl about on his toes, singing:</font></p>

<blockquote><font size="5">"I won't go away! I won't go away!<br>
 I'll stay all night, and I'll stay all day.<br>
 Oh, my cap and toes! I'm a gamblesome elf.<br>
 Old owl, you had better look out for
yourself."</font></blockquote>

<p><font size="5">The old owl looked in for a moment, and then
without a word she flew back to her nest as fast as she could.
Teddy ran over to the chimney and listened. He heard the old owl
brush into the hollow above, and then he heard her saying in a
frightened voice: "Husband, husband, what do you think! A
gamblesome elf has come to live in old Granddaddy Thistletop's
house."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, my tail-feathers!" cried old Father Owl
aghast. "This is bad business; we'll be having trouble and
mischief all the time now. It would have been better if we had
let old Thistletop stay. What shall we do?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Do! do!" cried old Mother Owl in an
exasperated voice; "what is there to do, I should like to know,
but to get the children away? I wouldn't keep them in the same
tree with that gamblesome elf --no, not a night longer --for all
the mice you could offer me."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"But how can we get them away?" asked old
Father Owl. "They can't fly."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"No, we can't fly!" cried all the little owls.
"Oh, what shall we do? Ow! Ow!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Can't fly! They've <i>got</i> to fly," said
Mother Owl, "and you and I must help them. Back to the old tree
we go this very night."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After that there was a great to-do up in the
hollow. Teddy watched it all lying on his stomach in the door of
the knot-hole, for it was moonlight by this time and almost as
bright as day.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The little owls got up on the edge of the
hollow and there they sat, teetering and flapping and afraid to
fly. Their mother grew crosser and crosser, and at last she got
back of them and gave them a push, and then down they went,
fluttering and tumbling and bumping into the
tree-trunks.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The Father Owl sailed about from branch to
branch, calling, "Who-o-o-o! Who-o-o! Come on! Spread your wings
and go like this. Who-o-o-o!" and then he would sail on to
another bush; but the Mother Owl flew down beside them and showed
them how to spread their wings, and pushed them with her beak,
and gradually the fluttered farther and farther into the darkling
woods, their cries growing fainter and then dying away until all
Teddy could hear was the Father Owl's voice, very faint and far
away. "Who-o-o! Who-o-o!" Then it too died away, and the woods
were still.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After a while the moon set and Teddy began to
feel very sleepy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then a little breeze sprang up; the light grew
clearer and the east was red, and at last the sun peeped over the
top of the hill opposite.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As the first beam struck old Granddaddy
Thistletop's tree, Teddy started to his knees, gazing out down
the hill-slope. There were the four black-and-yellow butterflies
flying directly toward the tree as fast as their wings could
carry them, and on the two foremost ones were old Granddaddy
Thistletop himself and the beautiful Rosine.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">They drew rein at the knot-hole, and the old
fairy, skipping from his butterfly and never pausing to fasten
it, tottered straight to Teddy and threw his arms about his neck.
"Our preserver!" he cried. "And to think I should have called you
a gamblesome elf! But never mind; I will make it up to
you."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Suddenly he turned and caught the blushing
Rosine by the hand. "Here!" he cried; "she is yours, and you
shall live with us, and learn to turn your toes up, and we will
all be happy together."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"But --but --" cried Teddy, starting back,
"don't you know? I'm not an elf at all. I'm ---"</font></p>

<center><font size="5">* * * * * * *</font></center>

<p><font size="5">"Well, well! Here we are back again," said the
Counterpane Fairy, "and stiff enough I feel after all that
journeying."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh! wasn't it funny?" said Teddy, and his
knees shook with laughter. "They really thought I was a
gamblesome elf."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Take care!" cried the fairy. "There you are
shaking your knees again. I think, my dear, that if you were to
lower them very, very carefully, the hill would not be quite so
steep."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, ma'am, I'll be careful," said Teddy,
beginning very slowly to slide his feet down in the bed.
Suddenly, the door-knob turned, and Teddy gave a start; --quick
as a flash the Counterpane Fairy had disappeared.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">His mother was coming in carrying his breakfast
and a little vase of violets on a tray.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Why, my darling, what a bright, happy face!"
she said. "I think my little boy must be feeling better this
morning."</font></p>
