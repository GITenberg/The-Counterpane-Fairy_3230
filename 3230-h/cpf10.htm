<p><font size="5">EDDY was to go out-doors the next day if it was
mild and pleasant. The doctor had come in that morning for the
last time to see him. "Well, my little man," he had said, giving
Teddy's cheek a pinch, "can't be pretending you're a sick boy any
longer with cheeks and eyes like these. Now we'll have you back
at school in no time, and then I suppose you'll be up to all your
old tricks again."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Later on the little boy had gone downstairs for
dinner, for the first time since he had been ill. Everything
there had looked very strange to him, and as if he had not seen
it for years.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He had felt just as well as ever until he tried
to chase the cat, Muggins, down the hall, and then his legs had
given way in a funny, weak fashion that made him
laugh.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After dinner Muggins followed him upstairs, and
curling down under a chair went fast asleep. Teddy took his
blocks and built them about the chair, so that when the cat woke
he found himself built up inside a little house.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">However, a door had been left, and he poked his
nose and his paw through it, and then the whole front wall went
down with a noisy clatter, and Muggins scampered down to the
kitchen with his tail on end. Teddy had to laugh; he looked so
funny.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Papa came home from his office earlier than
usual that afternoon, bringing with him a bundle of long, smooth
sticks and a roll of tissue papers, and spent all the rest of the
time between that and supper in making a great kite for Teddy. He
told the little boy that if the next day were fine he would fly
it for him, and that he might ask some of the boys to come and
help.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy had never seen such a large kite before.
When papa stood it up it was a great deal taller than the little
boy himself. The gold star that was pasted on where the sticks
crossed was just on a level with his eyes.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">So much seemed to have happened that day that
very soon after supper Teddy felt tired and was quite willing to
let mamma undress him and put him to bed.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">It felt very good to lie down between the cool
sheets again, and very soon Teddy's eyelids began to blink
heavily, and he was already drifting off into that blissful
feeling that comes just as one is going to sleep, when he became
dimly conscious of a faint sound of music.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">At first, half asleep as he was, he thought
that it must be little Cousin Harriett winding up the music-box
in the room, and then he suddenly started into consciousness with
the remembrance that he was alone and that it couldn't be Cousin
Harriett. She was at home; in bed perhaps, already.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The music seemed to sound quite near him, and
it was very sweet and soft. Now that he was awake it sounded more
like the voice of the singing garden than anything
else.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Suddenly a faint rosy light appeared at the
foot of the bed, and standing in it was the most beautiful lady
that Teddy had ever seen. She was quite tall,--as tall as his own
mother, and not even the fairy Rosine, or the Bird-maiden,--no,
nor the Princess Aureline herself, had been half as
beautiful.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">But though the lady was so lovely there was
something very familiar about her face. "Why, Counterpane Fairy!"
cried Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The Counterpane Fairy, for it was indeed she,
did not speak, but smiling at Teddy she moved softly and
smoothly, as though swept along by the music to the side of the
bed, and, still smiling, she bent above the little
boy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As he looked up into the face that leaned above
him, it seemed to change in some strange way, and now it was the
old Italian woman who had given him the presents from her basket;
a moment after it was the face of the little child who had talked
with him upon the rainbow; no, it was not; it was really the
Counterpane Fairy herself, and no one else.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Closer and closer she leaned above him, seeming
to enfold him with faint music and light and perfume. "Good-bye,"
she whispered softly. "Good-bye! little boy."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, Counterpane Fairy! where are you going?
Don't go away!" cried Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I'm not going away," said the fairy. "I shall
be beside you still just as often as ever, only you won't see
me."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"But won't there be any more stories?" cried
Teddy, in dismay.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Sometime, perhaps," said the Counterpane
Fairy, "but not now, for to-morrow you'll be out and playing with
the other boys, and after that it will be your school and your
games that you'll be thinking of."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, Counterpane Fairy, don't go!" cried Teddy
again, reaching out his arms toward her; but they touched nothing
but empty air. Waving her hand to him and still smiling, the
Counterpane Fairy slowly, slowly faded away. With her too, faded
the rosy light and the perfume that had filled the room; only the
faint sound of music was left. Then it too died away.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy sat up and looked about him. The room was
very still and dim. He heard nothing but the ticking of the
clock. The half-moon had sailed up above the dark tops of the
pine-trees on the lawn outside, and by its light he saw the great
kite that papa had made him, as it stood propped up on the
mantle. The gilt star in the middle of it shone.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">It was true that he was no longer a little sick
child. To-morrow he would be out-of-doors again, and shouting and
playing with all the other boys.</font></p>
