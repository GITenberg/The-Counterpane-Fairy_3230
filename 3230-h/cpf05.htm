<p><font size="5">HE crocuses are up on the lawn," said Teddy's
mother, who was standing at the window and looking out. "And just
hear that blackbird! I always feel as though spring were really
here when I hear the blackbirds sing."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy was still in bed. It seemed to him
sometimes that he had spent his whole life lying there in the
India-room, under the silk counterpane, and that it was some
other Teddy who used to go to school and shout and play with the
boys in the street.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I wish I could go out-of-doors the way I used
to," he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"So do I," said mamma. "But never mind,
darling. The doctor says it won't be so very long now before you
can be out again, and this afternoon we'll play some nice game or
other that you can play in bed. Now what would you like it to
be?" But before Teddy could answer she added, "Oh dear! There
comes Aunt Mariah."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Aunt Mariah lived down at the other end of the
village, and she generally came every fortnight to spend an
afternoon with Teddy's mother. She always brought her knitting in
a bag, and a white net cap that she put on before the glass as
soon as she had taken her bonnet off.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy liked to have her come, her needles flew
so fast, and she used to recite to him, --</font></p>
          
          <pre>
          "A was an archer, and shot at a frog;<br>
           B was a butcher, and had a great dog."
           </pre>

<p><font size="5">Then when he was tired of sitting with her and
mamma, he could run out-of-doors and play.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">But he found it was different to-day from what
it had been before. He was still weak from his illness, and after
she had told him all the verses that she knew, he grew weary of
hearing her talk of Cousin George's wife, and Mrs. Appleby's
rheumatism.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">His mother saw that he was growing restless and
that his cheeks were flushed, so she asked Aunt Mariah to come
over to her room to look at some calico she had been
buying.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">When they had gone Teddy lay for a time
enjoying the silence of the room, but after a while it began to
seem too still and the clock ticked with a strange loud sound. He
wished Aunt Mariah would go away and let mamma come back again.
It was so lonely, and he was tired of his books.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He was lying on his back, and presently he drew
up his knees, and then over the tops of them he could only see
the upper half of the window, and the tips of the pine-trees
against the still blue sky outside.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh dear, dear, dear!" said the Counterpane
Fairy's voice just behind the hill. "Steeper than ever to-day.
Will I ever get to the top?" A minute after he saw her little
figure standing on the hill, dark against the sky, and the staff
in her hand like a thin black line.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, dear Counterpane Fairy!" cried Teddy,
"have you come to show me another story?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Are you sure you want to see one?" asked the
Counterpane Fairy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, yes, yes, I do!" cried Teddy. "Your
stories don't make me feel tired the way Aunt Mariah's
do."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The fairy shook her head. "I thought her
stories were very pleasant," she said.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"So they are," said Teddy, "but I like her
stories best when I'm all well, and I like your stories best when
I'm sick. Besides I only hear her stories and I see
yours."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The fairy smiled. "Well, then, which square
will you choose this time?" she said.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I think I would like that one," said Teddy,
pointing to a square of watered ribbon that shaded from white to
a sea-green.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"That's rather a long story," said the fairy,
doubtfully.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, please show it!" begged Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well," said the Fairy, "fix your eyes on it
while I count."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then she began and he heard her voice going on
and on. "FORTY-NINE!" she cried.</font></p>

<center><font size="5">* * * * * * * *</font></center>

<p><font size="5">Teddy was floating on a block of ice across the
wide, green Polar sea. The Counterpane Fairy was with him, and
all around were great fields of ice and floating white bergs. The
air was very still and cold, but Teddy liked it all the better
for that, for now he was an ice-fairy. He was dressed from head
to foot in a suit that shone and sparkled like woven frost, and
in his belt was a knife as shining as an icicle. Something kept
bobbing and tickling his forehead, and when he caught hold of it
he found it was the end of the long cap he wore.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As they drifted along, sometimes they saw a
walrus with long tusks lying on the ice, or a soft-eyed seal.
Once some strange little beings that looked like dwarfs, with
goggle eyes and straggling black hair, caught hold of the block
of ice, and lifting themselves out of the water made faces at
Teddy, but the moment they saw the Counterpane Fairy their looked
changed to one of fear, and with a queer gurgling cry they
dropped from the ice and were gone.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"What were those things?" asked
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"They were ice-mermen," said the Counterpane
Fairy. "Naughty, mischievous things they are. I'd like to pack
them all off to the North Pole if I could."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, look! look!" cried Teddy. "Just look at
those little bears playing over there."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">They had drifted in quite near to the shore,
and in among the blocks of ice three white bear cubs were playing
together like fat little boys. They were climbing to the top of
an ice-hillock and then sliding down again.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As soon as they saw Teddy and the Counterpane
Fairy they began to call: "Oh, Father Bear! Father Bear! Just
come look at these funny things floating in to shore on a block
of ice."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">In a moment from behind the ice-hill came a
great white father bear galloping up as fast as he could to see
what the matter was. He came over toward Teddy growling,
"Gur-r-r! gur-r-r-r! Who are you, coming and frightening my
little bears this way?" But as soon as he saw the Counterpane
Fairy he grew quite humble. "Oh, excuse me," he said. "I didn't
know it was a friend of yours."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, it is," said the fairy, "and I have
brought him here to stay awhile. Will you take good care of
him?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, I will," said Father Bear. "He shall
sleep in the cave with us and have part of our meat if he will,
and I will be as careful of him as though he were one of my own
cubs."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Very well," said the fairy; "mind you do."
Then turning to Teddy she bade him step on shore.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"But aren't you coming too?" asked
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"No," said the Counterpane Fairy, "I can't
come, but Father Bear will take good care of you." So Teddy
stepped onto the shore, and the fairy pushed the block of ice out
into the water, and waving her hand to him she drifted away
across the open sea.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The Father Bear stood watching her until she
was out of sight, and then he turned to Teddy. "Now, you Fairy,"
he said, "you may climb up onto my back, and I'll carry you to my
wife; she'll take good care of you for as long as the Counterpane
Fairy chooses to leave you here."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The three little bears cubs had disappeared,
but as soon as the Father Bear carried Teddy around the hill of
ice he saw what had become of them. They were sitting with the
Mother Bear at the door of a cave. One of them was sucking its
paws, and the other two were talking as fast as they could. The
Mother Bear looked worried and anxious.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"What's all this Dumpy and Sprawley are telling
me?" she said. "And what's that you have on your
back?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"It's an ice-fairy," growled old Father Bear,
"and the Counterpane Fairy wants us to take care of it for a
while. You don't mind, my dear, do you?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh dear, dear!" said the Mother Bear, "I
suppose not, but what shall we give it to eat, and how shall we
keep it?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, it will do just the other cubs do, I
suppose," said the Father Bear. Then turning to Teddy he said,
"You eat meat, don't you?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, sir," answered Teddy, timidly.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Then that's all right," said the Father Bear.
"Here, you children, take this fairy off and let him play with
you."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Two of the little bears, Fatty (who was the one
who had been sucking his paws) and Dumpy, were delighted to have
a new playmate, and they told him he might come over and slide
down their hill, but the third one, Sprawley, scowled and
grumbled. "Another one to be eating up our meat," he said. "Just
as if there weren't enough of us without."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Still he went over with them to the icehill and
they all began sliding down.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After a while Sprawley said: "I know a great
deal nicer hill than this one. It's just a little farther on;
come on and I'll show it to you."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh," said Fatty, "but suppose we should see
some ice-mermen?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Pooh!" said Sprawley, "I ain't afraid. It's a
great deal nicer than this. Come on."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">So the three little bears and Teddy trotted on
to another hill, and it really was much longer and steeper than
the other; it went down almost to the edge of the sea.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">They had slidden down it only a few times when
Dumpy cried out: "Oh! look! look! There are some ice-mermen and
they are making faces at me."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">There they were, sure enough, looking over the
edge of the ice, -- ugly little gray things with mouths like
fishes, and they were making faces, and presently they began to
sing, --</font></p>
    
    <pre>
    "Bear cubs! Bear cubs! Look at their toes;<br>
     Look at their ears and their hair and their nose.<br>
     The great big walrus will surely come<br>
     To eat up the bear cubs and give us some."
     </pre>

<p><font size="5">Dumpy growled at them, though he was
frightened, but Fatty began to cry.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Just then one of the mermen sent a piece of ice
sliding across at them, and it hit Fatty's paws and upset her.
She was so fat that she rolled over and over before she could get
up. Dumpy ran to her, and as soon as she was on her feet again
they began galloping toward home as fast as they could, followed
by Sprawley and Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As they ran along Teddy saw that Sprawley was
shaking all over, and he thought it was because he was afraid,
until he caught up to him; then he saw that he was laughing.
"What are you laughing at?" he asked, but Sprawley only showed
his teeth and growled in answer.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">When they reached the cave and told the Mother
Bear about the mermen she scolded them well for going so near the
edge of the water, and said it was time for them to go to bed.
Father Bear was going on a hunt the next day, and he was going to
let the cubs go part of the way with him, so they must have a
good rest.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The Mother Bear gave them each their share of
seal meat, and then she went into the cave.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, Fatty," said Sprawley, "just look behind
you and see if you don't see a merman."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Fatty turned her head, but there was nothing
there. When she looked back again she burst into a loud whine.
"Ou-u-u! ou-u-u-u!" she cried, "Sprawley stole my nicest piece of
meat, so he did. Ou-u-u!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Out shuffled Mother Bear in a hurry. "You
naughty cub," she cried, aiming a blow at Sprawley's ear. But
quick as a wink Sprawley slipped behind Dumpy, and it was upon
Dumpy that the blow fell.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">And now Dumpy joined in with his sister.
"Ou-u-u!" he cried.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"There, there!" cried the poor Mother Bear,
"don't you cry any more and I'll give you each an extra piece of
meat."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">So they stopped crying and ate their suppers
contentedly, and after that they all went to bed, and the little
cubs had hardly lain down before they were fast
asleep.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy did not go to sleep, however. He lay
looking at the ice-roof of the cave and thinking how strange it
was to be there. Presently he heard the Mother Bear say very
softly, "Husband, husband, are you awake?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, I am," said the Father Bear. "What do you
want?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The Mother Bear sighed. "I don't know how it
is, husband," she said, "but I never had a cub like Sprawley
before. He is so naughty and mischievous that he keeps his little
brother and sister whining all the time."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"You ought to box him," said the Father
Bear.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"That's all very well," said the Mother Bear,
"but when I try to box him he slips behind the others and pushes
them forward, and he is so quick that twice I have boxed Dumpy
instead of him by mistake."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The Father Bear grunted and they were silent
for a while, but presently the Mother Bear began again, more
softly than ever. "Do you know, husband, sometimes I wonder
whether Sprawley can really be my cub. If I could only count them
I might find out. If there were only one and one I could count
them, but there are more than one and one."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well," said Father Bear, "I should think that
would be easy. Let's see. There's Dumpy, and he's one, and Fatty,
and she's one, and Sprawley, and he's one. And now how many does
that make?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh dear!" said the Mother Bear, "Don't ask me.
My head's all of a whirl already."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Then you'd better go to sleep, my dear," said
her husband. "The next thing you know you'll be having a headache
to-morrow. You think too much."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes," said the Mother Bear, sighing, "That's
so; I suppose I do think too much, but then I can't help it. I
always was thinking ever since I was a cub. It's the way I'm
made. Good-night."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Good-night," said the Father Bear, and then
they, too, went to sleep.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy seemed to be the only one left awake.
Dumpy kept crowding up against him and snoring with his nose
close to Teddy's ear. Teddy pushed him once or twice, but it
didn't seem to make any difference. Once he poked him so hard
that the little bear gave a snort and stopped snoring for a
while, but soon he began again.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">But after all Teddy found he was not the only
one in the cave who was not asleep. Sprawley, who was lying on
the other side of Fatty, had began to stir and sit up; he looked
about at the sleeping bears, and then very quietly began to edge
himself toward the mouth of the cave.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Once the Mother Bear gave a low growl in her
sleep and Sprawley stopped still to listen, but she didn't
waken.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy wondered what Sprawley was going to do,
and so, as soon as the cub had disappeared through the mouth of
the cave, he too crawled over to the opening.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">When he looked out he saw Sprawley shuffling
over the fields of ice in the distance, and already quite far
away, so, led by his curiosity, Teddy, too, crept out of the cave
and set off running after the bear cub.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He ran on and on until he was quite close to
Sprawley, and then he saw the cub pause at the edge of a strip of
open water, and turn to look behind him to make sure that he was
not followed. He did not see Teddy, for the fairy had hidden
quickly behind a block of ice.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Sprawley turned toward the water again and gave
a long, quavering cry that sounded like a call. He listened, but
everything was silent except for the rumbling and cracking of the
ice in the distance. Again he called, and this time there was an
answering cry, and another, and another. Sprawley stood up and
waved his paws, and then Teddy saw that the open water was dotted
with heads of ice-mermen; there must have been ten or twelve of
them at least.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">They swam over to where Sprawley stood, and
climbing out on the ice they seemed to be welcoming him, hopping
and sliding about, and pulling at his hair and claws. Now that
Teddy saw them quite close they were uglier than ever, with
goggle eyes, and rough, fishy-looking skins.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">They all sat on the edge of the ice, and now
and then one of them would dive off, to reappear again, all wet
and glistening, and then it would climb up and sit on the ice
again in a row with the others. They all talked together, and
their voices were so queer and husky that Teddy could not
understand what they were saying at first. At last he made out
that they were asking Sprawley about him, --where he had come
from, and how.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well, I'll tell you how he came," said
Sprawley, and all the mermen stopped to listen. Sprawley, too,
was silent for a moment, and then he said in a low, impressive
voice, "The Counterpane Fairy brought him."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">There was a long, quavering cry from the
mermen, and several of them dived off into the water and did not
reappear again for some minutes; when they did, their faces were
all wrinkled up with anxiety.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">They climbed up onto the edge of the ice and
sat there blinking at the sky for a while in silence; then one of
them said in a trembling voice, "Well, we haven't been doing
anything but just frightening the bear cubs a little."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"How about knocking Fatty down with a piece of
ice?" asked Sprawley, derisively.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Scritchy did that," cried all the mermen but
one. "We didn't do it. Scritchy did that."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The merman who hadn't spoken, and who was
Scritchy, still did not say a word. He looked at the others with
his goggle eyes and then he tumbled off into the water and swam
away as fast as he could and did not come back any
more.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">All the other mermen looked after him in
silence until he had disappeared; then one of them said in an
awe-struck voice, "It's bad for you, Sprawley, ain't it? Just
think what you've been doing."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Pooh," said Sprawley, pretending he was not
frightened, "what do I care? I can fix it all right."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"How?" asked all the mermen
together.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well, listen, and I'll tell you," said
Sprawley. "To-morrow Father and Mother Bear are going hunting,
and all of us little cubs are to go with them. I suppose this
strange fairy cub will go with us, and when we stop to rest I'll
get him away from the others and near the edge of the water. You
must come under the ice and break off the piece he is standing
on, and float him far, far away toward the South until he
melts."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, yes! we'll do it," cried all the mermen
jumping about and shouting. Then they turned to Sprawley. "Come,"
they cried, "let's have a game in the water before you go
back."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"That I will," said Sprawley, and with that
what should he do but strip off his bear-skin just as though it
were a coat, and there he was, nothing more nor less than a
merman who had been dressed up in an old skin, pretending to be a
bear cub.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Sprawley and all the other mermen dived off
into the water and began splashing and shrieking and pulling at
each other and getting farther and farther away.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"All the same, I don't think you'll float me
off," said Teddy to himself.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Very quietly he crept to where the bear-skin
lay on the ice, and taking out his knife he cut a long slit up
the back of it. Then not waiting for the mermen to come back he
hurried home again over the ice to the bears' cave, and crawling
in he laid himself down again between the sleeping
cubs.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The little bears were beginning to stir
themselves and the Mother Bear was yawning and stretching when
Sprawley came sneaking into the cave again.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Why! why!" said the Mother Bear, "where have
you been?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I ain't been anywhere," said Sprawley. "I just
thought I heard a sea-lion roaring and I went out to
see."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well, there's no use your going to sleep
again," said the Father Bear, "for we have to go a long ways
to-day, and it's time we were getting ready to start
now."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">With that he shuffled out of the cave, followed
by the Mother Bear, and stood looking about him. Presently the
cubs came out, too, still blinking with sleep.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, Mother!" cried Dumpy, "just look at
Sprawley's back!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Why, what's the matter with it?" asked the
Mother Bear.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"There ain't anything the matter with it,"
growled Sprawley, twisting his head round and trying to
see.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, there is too!" cried Fatty. "Oh my!
Sprawley's splitting hisself all down the back."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Why! why!" cried the Father Bear, "what's
this?" He shuffled over and looked at Sprawley's back, and then
without a word he began to tear and pull at the bear-skin. In
another minute he had it off, and there stood the merman
shivering and blinking at them with his mouth open like a gasping
fish.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh dear! oh dear!" cried the Mother Bear,
turning whiter than ever. "He's not my cub after all," and she
sat down and began to whine and cry. But Father Bear gave a
growl, and rising on his hind legs he fetched the merman a cuff
that sent him tumbling head over heels across the ice.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Father Bear was after him, but before he could
reach him the merman was up and running for the open strip of
water in the distance. Father Bear chased him the whole way;
sometimes he caught him and gave him a cuff that sent him flying,
but at last the merman reached the water and dived into it. He
must have had a sore head for days afterward, however.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">When the Father Bear came back again, he was
panting and growling. "There," said he, "I guess that's the last
time any of the mermen will try to play their tricks on us. Come,
come," he went on, "it's time we were off for our
hunting."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">But the Mother Bear only shook her head. She
had been doing nothing since she saw that Sprawley was an
ice-merman but sit and rock herself backward and forward and
whine. "I couldn't go, my dear; I couldn't indeed," she said.
"I'm all of a tremble now to think how that dreadful merman has
been playing with Fatty and Dumpy day after day and I never knew
it."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Then I'll go by myself," said Father Bear,
gruffly, "and leave the children home with you. But you can go,
Fairy," he said to Teddy. "I'll carry you on my back if you like,
and maybe you'll see me catch a young walrus. I suppose it was
you who split him down the back, as the Counterpane Fairy brought
you."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, sir, it was," said Teddy, timidly; "but
I'm afraid I can't go with you; I'm afraid I'm going back," --for
the bears, the fields of ice, the far-off green water, were all
wavering and growing misty before his sight. Faintly he heard the
voices of the bear cubs: "Owie! owie! don't go away"; for they
had grown fond of him the day before.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then their voices died away. He was back in the
old familiar room with the Counterpane Fairy perched upon his
knees, and a bunch of snowdrops in the vase beside the bed. The
door opened and his mother stood holding the knob in her hand and
speaking to Hannah outside, and in that moment the Counterpane
Fairy was gone.</font></p>
