</center>

<p><font size="5"><img src="images/T2.gif" width="45" height="42" alt=

<p><font size="5">EDDY had begged mamma to ask Harriett to come
over and play with him after school, but not to tell her that now
he was no longer in bed, so when the little girl came running in
she was very much surprised. "Why, Teddy, you're well again,
aren't you?" she cried.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, now I'm well again," said Teddy "and
mamma says we may each have a little sponge-cake, and she's going
to let us blow soap-bubbles. Would you like to blow soap-bubbles,
Harriett?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, I guess so," said Harriett.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">So mamma made them a bowl of strong suds, and
brought out two pipes, and the children played together very
happily for quite a time. Sometimes they threw the bubbles into
the air and tried to blow them up to the ceiling; sometimes the
children put their pipes close together, so that the bubbles they
blew were joined in one lopsided globe.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Last of all they set the bowl on a chair, and
kneeling beside it put their pipes into the suds, and blew and
blew until quite a soap-bubble castle rose up and touched their
noses with wet suds.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy felt a little tired and soapy by that
time, so mamma put all the things away, and read them some
stories from Grimm's <i>Fairy Tales</i>.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After that Harriett said she must go home, and
indeed it was almost supper-time, so mamma helped her put on her
little hat and coat and kissed her good-bye.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy was very tired by the time supper was
over; he felt quite willing to be put to bed, and as soon as he
was there he sank into a doze.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">When he awoke again he was alone; it was quite
dark outside, but mamma had set a lamp behind the screen. By its
dim light Teddy saw the Counterpane Fairy's brown hood appearing
above the hill, and he heard her sighing to herself: "Oh dear! oh
dear!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, Mrs. Fairy!" cried the little boy, almost
before she had reached the top of the hill, "I'm so glad you've
come, for I don't know when mamma will be here. Won't you show me
a story?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"In a minute! in a minute!" said the fairy. "As
soon as I can catch my breath."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy was so afraid that mamma would come in
that he could hardly wait, and when the Counterpane Fairy told
him that she was ready and that he might choose a square, he made
haste and pointed out a silvery gray one. Then the fairy began to
count. "FORTY-NINE!" she cried.</font></p>

<center><font size="5">* * * * * * * *</font></center>

<p><font size="5">Teddy was walking down a long, smooth, gray
road. There was a silvery mist all about him, so that it was
almost as though he were walking through the sky, and the road
seemed to begin and end in grayness.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He knew that somewhere behind him lay his home,
and that in front was the place where he was going, but he did
not know what that place was.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">At last he reached the edge of a wide gray lake
as smooth and as shining as glass. Beside him on the beach a
little gray bird was crouching. "Peet-weet! peet-weet!" cried the
little gray bird.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">It was so close to Teddy's feet that it seemed
to him that with a single movement he could stoop and catch it.
Very softly he reached out his hand and the little bird did not
stir. "Peet-weet! peet-weet!" it cried. Suddenly with a quick
movement he clutched it. For a moment he thought that he felt it
in his fingers, all feathery and soft and warm, and then the
voice of the Counterpane Fairy cried, "Take care! you're rumpling
my cloak!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy dropped the bird as though it had burned
him, and there it was not a bird at all, but the Counterpane
Fairy, who stood smoothing down her cloak and frowning. "Oh! I
didn't know that was you; I thought it was a bird," cried
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"A bird!" cried the fairy. "Do I look like a
bird?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy thought that she did, for her nose was
long and thin, and her eyes were bright like those of a sparrow,
but he did not like to say so. All he said was, "I wonder why I
came here?" for now he knew that this was the place that he had
been coming to.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I suppose you came to see the dreams go by,"
said the Counterpane Fairy. "I often come for that
myself."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"The dreams go by!" said Teddy. "I don't know
what you mean."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Do you see that castle over yonder?" asked the
fairy, pointing out across the lake. Teddy looked as hard as he
could, and after a while he thought he did see the shadowy roofs
and turrets of a great gray castle through the mist.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I think I do," he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well," said the fairy, "that is where the
dreams live, and every evening they go sailing past here, on
their way to the people who are asleep, and I generally come down
to see them go by. Look! look! There goes one now."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">A little boat, as pale and light as a bubble,
was gliding through the mist; in it was seated a gray figure, and
as it passed the island it turned its face toward them and waved
a shadowy hand. Presently two more boats slid silently by, and
then another. "Oh, I know that dream!" cried Teddy; "I dreamed
that dream once myself."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Now there was a little pause, and then the
dreams began to go past so fast that Teddy lost count of
them.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">At last one of the boats gilded out of the line
of the rest, and over toward where Teddy was standing, running up
smoothly onto the gray beach, and out of it hopped a queer, ugly
little dream, with pop eyes and big hands and feet. As soon as he
found himself on shore he cut a caper and cracked his shadowy
fingers.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Who are you?" asked Teddy,
curiously.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, I'm just a dream," said the little
figure.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well, what are you coming here for?" asked
Teddy; "I'm not asleep."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I know you're not," said the dream, "and I'm
not coming to you. I'm going to a little girl named
Harriett."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, I know her!" cried Teddy. "She's my
cousin. But why are you her dream? You're not pretty."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I know I'm not pretty," answered the dream,
"and that's why I'm going to her. She was to have had such a
pretty dream to-night, but she ate a piece of plum-cake before
she went to bed, so now I'm going to her instead of the other
one."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"What was the other one like?" asked
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"There it is," said the dream, pointing toward
the boat. And now Teddy saw that another gray figure was in it.
As he looked, it slowly and sorrowfully stepped from the boat and
came up the beach toward them. It was very beautiful, and in its
hand it carried a great bunch of shining bubbles, fastened to a
stick by parti-colored ribbons, just as Teddy had seen Italians
carrying balloons, only these bubble-balloons were growing and
shrinking and changing every moment, just as though they were
alive.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As she came toward them the ugly dream frowned
and shook his hands at her. "Go away! Go away!" he cried.
"There's no use your following me around this way. You sha'n't be
dreamed to-night."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I think you might let me go into her dream
with you," said the pretty dream, sorrowfully. "She didn't know
she oughtn't to eat the plum-cake."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well, you sha'n't," said the ugly dream. "She
ain't going to have any dream but me, and I'm going to look just
as ugly as I can. I'm going to do this way," and the naughty
little dream put his thumbs in the corners of his mouth, drawing
it wide, and at the same time drew down the outside corners of
his eyes with his forefingers, just as Teddy had seen the boys at
school do sometimes. Then the dream hopped up into the air and
cut a caper. "Ho, ho!" he cried, "won't it be fun? You can come
along and see me frighten her, if you want to." This last he said
to Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy thought him a very naughty, ugly-tempered
little dream, but still he went with him, wondering all the time
how he could induce him to let the pretty dream go to Harriett,
and as they walked up the road together the pretty dream still
followed them, carrying her bunch of bubbles.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">They went on and on, until they came to a place
where the ground was rough, and broken up with a number of black
holes. The ugly dream went from one to another of these, pausing,
and laying his ear to their edges.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"What are you doing?" asked Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Hush! can't you see I'm listening?" said the
dream crossly.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">At last, after pausing at one of them, he
turned to Teddy and nodded his head. "This is it," he said; "this
is where Harriett lives."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Why, it isn't at all!" cried Teddy,
indignantly. "My cousin Harriett doesn't live in a hole! She
lives in a great big house with doors and windows."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well, anyway, this is her chimney," said the
dream, "and it's the only way to get into her house from here. If
you want to come, come; and if you don't want to, why, stay," and
the dream sat down on the edge of the hole.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy hesitated. "If I went down that way, I
think I'd fall and hurt myself," he said at last.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Pooh! No, you wouldn't if you took my hand,"
said the dream. "I always go this way, and it's as easy as
anything."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">So Teddy sat down on the edge of the hole, and
grasped the dream's shadowy fingers in his. Then they pushed
themselves off the edge, and down they went through the
darkness.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy felt so frightened for a minute that he
quite lost his breath, but he held on tight to the dream's
fingers, and soon they landed, as softly and lightly as a
feather, right in the nursery of Aunt Paulina's house, and the
pretty dream was still following them.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"And now begins the fun," whispered the
dream.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The house was very still, for everyone was fast
asleep. The moon shone in through the window, making the room
bright, and beyond the open closet door Teddy could see the toys
all arranged in order just as Harriett had left them, (for she
was a tidy little girl), and Harriett herself was tucked into her
little white bed in the room beyond.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy felt so sorry to think of her having such
an ugly dream that he stood still. "You won't frighten her very
much, will you?" he asked.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, I shall!" said the ugly dream. "I'll
frighten her just as much as ever I can; I'll make her
cry."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"No, you mustn't," said Teddy, almost crying
himself. "I won't let you."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"You can't help it," cried the dream,
tauntingly.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Suddenly a bright thought came into Teddy's
mind. "Anyway, you're not so very ugly," he said. "Harriet has a
Jack-in-the-box that's a great deal--oh! ever so much uglier than
you."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I don't believe it," said the
dream.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, she has," said Teddy; "and it's right
there in the closet."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Then I'll get it, and make myself look like
it." With that the dream crawled into the closet, and pushed back
the hook of the box where Jack lived, and pop! up shot the most
hideous little man that ever was seen, with a bright red face and
white whiskers. "Hi! he <i>is</i> ugly!" cried the dream with
delight, and sitting down before the box he began to make his
face like the Jack's.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then softly and quickly Teddy closed the closet
door, and turned the key in the lock, fastening the dream in. "Hi
there! let me out! let me out!" cried the dream, beating softly
on the door with its shadowy hands.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"No, I won't," cried Teddy. "You can just stay
in there, you ugly dream, for the pretty dream is going to
Harriett now." Then he turned to the pretty dream and took her by
the hand, and her face shone as brightly as one of her own
bubbles.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Together they ran into Harriett's room, and
there she lay in her little white bed, with her eyes closed and
her curls spread out over the pillow, and when they came in she
smiled in her sleep.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The dream shook the bubbles above the bed, and
the dimples came into Harriett's cheeks. "Oh! pretty, pretty!"
she whispered with her eyes still closed. "Oh, Teddy? isn't it
pretty?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, it is pretty!" cried Teddy.</font></p>

<center><font size="5">* * * * * * * *</font></center>

<p><font size="5">"Did you call me, dear?" asked mamma, opening
the door.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy was back in his own room, and all he
could see of the Counterpane Fairy was the tip of her brown hood
disappearing behind the counterpane hill, and that was gone in an
instant.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, Mamma! it was such a pretty dream," cried
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Was it, darling?" said mamma. "Try to go to
sleep again, dear, for it is very late, and you can tell me all
about it to-morrow. Good-night, my little boy."</font></p>
