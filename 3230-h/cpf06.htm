<p><font size="5">HE next day, in spite of the doctor's promises,
Teddy was not allowed to sit up.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">It was a raw, blustering day, and every feeling
of spring seemed gone from the air; the wind rattled at the
windows, and Hannah built up the fire until it roared.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy did not feel much disappointed at not
being allowed to sit up, for Harriett came over with her
paint-box, and they began coloring the pictures in some old
magazines that mamma gave them; the bed was littered with the
pages.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After a while mamma left them and went down
into the kitchen to bake a cake.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I wish I had brought my best apron over," said
Harriett, "for then I could have stayed for dinner if you wanted
me to."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Why can't you stay anyhow?" asked
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, I can't," said Harriett. "I must go to
dancing-class right after dinner, and I have to wear my apron
with the embroidered ruffles."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Harriett, why don't you go home and get it,
and then perhaps you could have diner up here with me; wouldn't
you like that?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, but maybe Aunt Alice doesn't want me to
stay."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, she does," said Teddy. "I know she does,
because she said she was so glad to have you come and amuse
me."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well, I'll go home and ask my mother. I don't
know whether she'll let me."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"You won't stay long, will you?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"No, I won't," promised Harriett. Then she put
on her jacket and hat and ran down-stairs.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy went on with his painting by himself for
a while, but it seemed to him Harriett was gone a long time. He
called his mother once, and she came to the foot of the stairs
and told him she couldn't come up just yet.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then Teddy began thinking of the Counterpane
Fairy, and the stories she had shown him. He wondered if she
wouldn't come to see him to-day. She always came when he was
lonely, and he was quite sure he was getting lonely now. Yes, he
knew he was.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well," said a little voice just back of the
counterpane hill, "it's not quite so steep to-day, and that's a
comfort." There was the little fairy just appearing above the
tops of his knees, -- brown hood, brown cloak, brown staff, and
all. She sat down with her staff in her hand and nodded to him,
smiling. "Good-morning," she said.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Good-morning," said Teddy. "Mrs. Fairy, I was
wondering whether you wouldn't like it if I kept my knees down,
and then there wouldn't be any hill."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"No," said the fairy, "I like to be up high so
that I can look about me, only it's hard climbing sometimes. Now,
how about a story? Would you like to see one to-day?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, yes!" cried Teddy. "Indeed, I
would."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Then which square will you choose? Make haste,
for I haven't much time."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I think I'll take that red one," said
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Very good," said the fairy, and then she began
to count.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As she counted, the red square spread and
glowed until it seemed to Teddy that he was wrapped in a mist of
ruddy light. Through it he heard the voice of the Counterpane
Fairy counting on and on, and as she counted he heard, with her
voice, another sound, --at first very faintly, then more and more
clearly: clink-clank! clink-clank! clink-clank! It reminded him a
little of the ticking of the clock on the mantle, only it was
more metallic.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"FORTY-NINE!" cried the Counterpane Fairy,
clapping her hands.</font></p>

<center><font size="5">* * * * * * * *</font></center>

<p><font size="5">And now the sound rang loud and clear in
Teddy's ears; it was the beating of hammers upon
anvils.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">When Teddy looked about him he was standing on
a road that ran along the side of a mountain. All along this road
were openings that looked like the mouths of caverns, and from
these openings poured the ceaseless sound of beating, and a ruddy
glow that reddened all the air and sky.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">It all seemed very familiar to Teddy, and he
had a feeling that he had seen it before.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Stepping to the nearest cavern he looked in,
and there he saw the whole inside of the mountain was hollowed
out into forges that opened into each other be means of rocky
arches. In every forge were little dwarfs dressed in leather and
hammering at pieces of red-hot iron that lay on the
anvils.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As Teddy stood looking in he was so tall that
his head almost touched the top of the doorway. He was dressed in
a long red cloak, and under that he wore a robe fastened about
the waist with a girdle of rubies that shone and sparkled in the
light; upon his hand was a ruby ring. The stone of the ring was
turned inward toward the palm, but it was so bright that the
light shone through his fingers, and he drew his cloak over his
hand that the dwarfs might not see it, for it was not yet time
for them to know that he was King Fireheart.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After a while the iron that the little men were
beating had to be put in the fire again to heat, and then they
turned and looked at Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Good-day," said he.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Good-day," answered the dwarfs, staring hard
at him.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"What are you making there?" asked
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"A link," answered the dwarfs.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"A link!" said Teddy. "What for?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"For a chain," answered the dwarfs, and then
the iron was hot and they took it out again and laid it on the
anvil. Clink-clank! clink-clank! clink-clank! went their
hammers.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy watched them at their work for a while,
and then he went on to the next forge, and there it was the same
thing -- more little dwarfs hammering away at their anvils as if
their lives depended on it.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Good-day," said Teddy, as soon as they paused
to heat the iron.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Good-day," said the dwarfs.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"What are you making there?" asked
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"A link," answered the dwarfs.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"What for?" said Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"For a chain," answered the dwarfs, and then
they set to work again.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy went on and on through the forges, and in
every one of them were little dwarfs hammering away on
links.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">When he came to the last forge of all, they
were just finishing a link, and as they threw it into a tank of
water a cloud of steam rose, almost hiding them from view. They
were so busy that they paid no attention to Teddy when he spoke.
"Make haste! Make haste!" they cried to each other. "It is
growing late and she will soon be here."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">In a great hurry the dwarfs caught up the link
from the water and laid it on the anvil again, and then they all
stood back from it. Every noise has ceased through all the
forges, and the dwarfs were waiting in breathless stillness as
though for something to happen.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Suddenly, in the silence, Teddy heard a faint
tinkling as though of icicles struck lightly together, and at the
same moment he saw that a woman all in white had entered the
forge down at the other end. Her dress shone with all different
colors, just as icicles do when they hang in the sunlight, and as
the light of the fire caught it here and there, it almost looked
as though it were on fire. Her hair was very black, and she wore
a crown.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">She stepped up to the anvil that was in the
forge and laid her hand upon it. She was too far away for Teddy
to see what she did, but there was a clink as of something
breaking, and a low wail arose from the dwarfs that stood near
by. Then she passed on to the next anvil, and to the next, and to
the next, and at each one she paused and touched the link that
lay upon it, and always at that there was a clink, and a wail
arose from the dwarfs.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">At last she came to the very forge where Teddy
was, but he had drawn back behind the stone archway and she did
not see him. Gliding to the anvil, she stretched out her white
finger and laid it upon the link that the dwarfs had made, and
instantly, as soon as she touched it, the iron flew into pieces
with a clink.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The dwarfs burst into a low wail, but the woman
with the crown struck her hands together and stamped her foot in
a rage. "Fools! fools!" she cried. "Not yet one link that will
not fly into pieces at a touch. But you shall make the chain,
though it should take your very hearts to do it."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then, still scowling until her beautiful face
was like a thunder-cloud, and without a single glance at the
trembling dwarfs, she glided from the forge and was
gone.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The dwarf who held the pincers drew his arm
across his forehead to wipe off the sweat. "Come," said he, "let
us set to work, for now it's all to be done over
again."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"But tell me first," said Teddy, "what does
this all mean, and who is this woman with a crown who comes and
breaks your links with a touch as soon as you have finished
them?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Ah! that is a long, sad story," said the dwarf
who held the pincers.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, it is a long, sad story," echoed the
others. "You tell him, Leatherkin," they added.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well," said Leatherkin, sitting down on a rock
that lay close by, "it's this way. This mountain where we live is
only one of many that are called the Fire Mountains, because
their rocks are so red, and because they are all full of forges.
Here we dwarfs used to live happily enough, for our good King
Fireheart was so rich and strong that no one dared to make war on
us, and we were left in peace to do what we would.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"King Fireheart, however, was not contented,
for he wanted to see the world, so one day he set out on a
journey, no one knew whither, leaving the country in the charge
of his foster-brother.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"While he was away the Ice-Queen came with all
her white spearsmen and attacked the country and conquered it.
Then she set us all to work, for she knew that in all the world
there were no such smiths as the dwarfs of the Fire King's
country, and not until we have forged her the magic chain that
binds all but one's self will she set us free to go about out own
affairs again.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"That is why we are all working to forge the
links, and if we could but make one that would stand so much as a
touch of her finger we would have hopes of making it, but so far
not one has been made but what flies into pieces at her lightest
touch.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"But there," he added; "we must set to work,
for the days are all too short for what we have to
do."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Wait a bit," said Teddy, "I should like to
have a stroke at that chain myself. Will you lend me a hammer and
let me try?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"No, no," cried the dwarfs, shaking their
heads. "We have no time to waste in lending out hammers and
anvil."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Look!" said Teddy, taking off his ruby girdle
and holding it out to them. "You shall have this if you will let
me try."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The dwarfs' eyes glittered, and they took the
girdle and all crowded around to look and handle it, for they had
never seen such fine rubies before, not even down in the middle
of the earth; and at last they told Teddy that they would lend
him their hammers awhile in exchange for the ruby girdle. "Though
what can you do with them?" they said, "for look at your hands;
they are white and smooth, and not hairy and strong like
ours."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Never you mind," said Teddy, "for sometimes
white, smooth hands can do the work that others can't," and he
took one of their hammers in his hand as he spoke.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"What will you have to work with?" they
asked.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, anything at all," said Teddy, "if it is no
more than an old nail, so that it is something to begin
with."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The dwarfs laughed, and picking up an old nail
that was on the floor they laid it upon the anvil.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then Teddy raised the hammer, and the ruby of
the ring he wore throbbed and burned until his hand was hot, and
his arm was so strong that the hammer was like a feather in his
grasp.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As he beat and turned the nail he sang, and it
seemed to him that the fire sang with him, clear and thin, and
sounding like the voice of the Counterpane Fairy,--</font></p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><font size="5">"Hammer and turn!<br>
 The fire must burn,<br>
 The coals must glow,<br>
 The bellows blow.</font></blockquote>

<font size="5"><br>
 Beat, good hammer, loud and fast;<br>
 So the chain will be made at last.<br>
</font>
<blockquote><font size="5">"Clankety-clink!<br>
 We forge the link.<br>
 My hammer bold,<br>
 This chain must hold.</font></blockquote>

<font size="5"><br>
 The snow shall melt, the ice fly fast,<br>
 For the magic chain is wrought at last."</font></blockquote>

<p><font size="5">With these words Teddy threw down the hammer
and lifted the chain he had made, and it was as thin as a hair,
as light as a breath, and yet so strong that no power on earth
could break it.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The dwarfs sprang forward with a shout and
caught the chain in their crooked fingers. "Wonderful!
wonderful!" they cried. "It is indeed the magic chain that we
have been trying to make for all these years. Who are you,
wonderful stranger, for there is no smith among all the dwarfs
who can do what you have done?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then without a word Teddy raised his hand, and
held it up with the palm turned toward them so that they saw the
ruby in his ring, and when they saw it they shouted again in
their wonder and joy. "It is King Fireheart himself come back to
rule the country!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then all the dwarfs, even from the farthest
forges, came running up and gathered about the archway of the
forge where Teddy stood, and when they saw that it was indeed
King Fireheart they shouted and leaped and threw their caps up
into the air.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">When they had grown quieter Teddy bade them
take him to the Ice-Queen, so all the dwarfs led him out, and up
the mountain, on and on, until they came to a great castle built
of ice, but ruddy with the cold light of the aurora borealis that
shone behind it.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">They went into the hall, past the rows of white
spearsmen, and when the spearsmen would have stopped them the
dwarfs told them that they were carrying the magic chain that
binds all but one's self to the Queen, and so they let the little
men pass on, but all the while Teddy kept the ruby ring hidden
under his cloak.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">At last they came to the great chamber, where
the Queen sat on a magnificent throne of ice, and when she saw
the crowd she started to her feet. "Have you brought it? Have you
brought it?" she cried eagerly. "Have you brought me the magic
chain?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes," shouted the dwarfs all together, "we
have brought it."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then they stood still, and Teddy went on up the
steps along.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Where is it?" asked the Queen, and she
stretched out her hands.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"It is here," said Teddy. Very slowly he drew
it out from under his cloak, and then suddenly he threw it over
her. "And now take it!" he cried.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">It was in vain that the Queen struggled and
cried; the more she strove, the closer the chain drew about her,
for it was a magic chain. At last she stood still, panting. "Who
are you?" she asked.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then Teddy raised his hand, holding it open so
that she could see the ruby. "I am King Fireheart," he cried;
"and now take your own real shape, wicked enchantress that you
are."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">At these words the black-browed Queen gave a
cry that changed, even as she uttered it, to a croak, and a
moment after she was nothing but a great black raven that spread
its wings, and flew away over the heads of the dwarfs, out of the
window and on out of sight.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then Teddy turned and walked out of the great
ice-chamber and down the hall, followed in silence by the dwarfs.
As he went, the spearsmen started forward to lay hands upon him,
but as soon as they saw the ruby ring they stood, every man
stiffened just as he was, some leaning forward with outstretched
arm, some with their spears lifted, some with their mouths open,
but all of them turned to ice.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">When Teddy and the dwarfs had reached the
mountain road again they turned and looked back toward the
castle.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">A warm south wind was blowing, and the aurora
borealis had faded away. Already the castle was beginning to
melt; the spires and turrets were softening and dripping down.
There was a warm red light over everything, like the light of the
rising sun.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"And now," cried the dwarfs, "will your Majesty
come up to your own royal castle?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes," answered Teddy, "I will
come."</font></p>

<center><font size="5">* * * * * * *</font></center>

<p><font size="5">"Quick! quick!" cried the Counterpane Fairy.
"It's time to come back."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy was at home once more. There was the
flowered furniture, and the fire burning red upon the hearth.
"Tick-tock! tick-tock! tick-tock!" said the clock.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I must go," cried the fairy, hastily, "for I
heard your little cousin opening and shutting the side
door."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, wait!" cried Teddy. "Won't you wait and
let her see you too?" But the fairy was already disappearing
behind the counterpane hill. All he could see was the top of her
pointed hood. Then that too disappeared. The door was thrown open
and Harriett came running in bringing a breath of fresh
out-of-doors air with her. Her cheeks were red, and she looked
very pretty in her embroidered apron and pink ribbons.</font></p>
