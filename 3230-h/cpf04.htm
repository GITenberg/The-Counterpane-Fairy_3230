</center>

<p><font size="5"><img src="images/T2.gif" width="45" height="42" alt=

<p><font size="5">EDDY was still in bed, though the doctor had
said that very soon he might have the big chair wheeled up to the
window and sit there awhile. Now he was propped up against the
pillows playing with the paper circus his mother had brought to
him the day before.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">His little cousin Harriett had come in
yesterday to spend the afternoon with him, and together they had
cut out the figures -- the clown, the ring-master, the pretty
lady on the white horse, the acrobat on his coal-black steed, and
all the rest.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">This morning he had put some large books under
the bedquilt, and smoothed it over them so as to make a flat
plane, and was amusing himself setting the circus out, and
arranging his soldiers in a long procession as if they were the
audience coming to see it.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He seemed so well entertained that his mother
said she would go over to the sewing-room for a little while to
run up some seams on the machine.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">When Teddy was left alone he still went on
playing very happily, but as he set out the soldiers two by two,
he was really thinking of the Counterpane Fairy and her wonderful
stories.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The evening before he had fallen asleep while
his mother was reading something to his father (for they both sat
in Teddy's room in the evenings now that he was ill), and when he
woke they were talking together about him. They did not see that
his eyes were open, so they went on with what they were saying.
It was his mother who was speaking. "He's such an odd child," she
was saying; "just now he is full of this idea of the Counterpane
Fairy and her stories, and he talks of her just as though she
were real. I don't know where he got the idea. It isn't in any of
his book and I thought you must have been telling him about
it."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"No," said papa, "I didn't tell
him."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Perhaps it was Harriett," said mamma, and then
she saw that he was awake and began to speak of something
else.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy wished his mother could see the
Counterpane Fairy herself, and then she would know that it was a
real fairy and not a make-believe. When he saw the Counterpane
Fairy again he was going to ask her if he mightn't take his
mother into one of the stories with him.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">He was thinking of her so hard that it did not
surprise him at all to hear her little thin voice just back of
the counterpane hill. "Oh dear, dear! and the worst of it is that
I hardly get to the top before I have to come down
again."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Is that you, Counterpane Fairy?" called
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes it is," said the fairy. "I'll be there in
a minute;" and soon she appeared above the top of the hill, and
seated herself on it to rest, and catch her breath. "Dear, dear!"
she said, "but it's a steep hill."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Mrs. Fairy," said Teddy, "I want to ask you
something. You know my mother?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes," said the Counterpane Fairy, "I know who
she is."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well," said Teddy, "she's just gone over into
the sewing-room, and I want to know whether you won't let me take
her into a square sometime."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"My mercy, no!" said the fairy. "Have you
forgotten what I told you the first time I came?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"What was that?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I told you I went to see little boys and
girls. I don't go to see grown people. They wouldn't believe in
me."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"My mother would," said Teddy. "She plays with
me and she likes my books and I tell her all about
you."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"No, no!" cried the Counterpane Fairy, "I
couldn't think of it. I'm very glad to take you into my stories,
but if you don't care to go by yourself --" and she picked up her
staff and rose as though she were going.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, I do, I do!" cried Teddy. "Please don't go
away."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Well, I won't," said the fairy, sitting down
again, "if you really want me to show you another. Have you
chosen a square?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"No, I haven't yet," said Teddy. He looked the
squares over very carefully, and at last he chose the
black-and-white one where the circus was standing.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Very good," said the fairy. "Now I'm going to
begin to count." Teddy fixed his eyes on the square and she
commenced.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Gradually he began to feel as though the white
silk of the square was a pale cloudy sky. Before him stretched a
white streak, and in the distance were some things like black
squares; he did not know quite what.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"FORTY-NINE!" cried the fairy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">When Teddy looked about him he and the
Counterpane Fairy were journeying along a dusty white road
together, and the fairy looked just as any little old woman
might, except that her eyes were so bright behind her
spectacles.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Before them lay a city with black roofs and
spires; there was a sound of drums and music in the distance, and
a faint noise as though a crowd of people were shouting a great
way off.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"What are they doing over there?" asked Teddy,
hurrying his steps a little. "Is it a parade?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"No," said the fairy, "it's not a parade, but
it is a grand merrymaking, and it's because of it that I've
brought you here. But I'm tired and hungry, for we've come a long
way, so let us sit down by the roadside a bit, and while we rest
I'll tell you all about the goings on and what we have to do with
them."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy was quite willing, so he and the
Counterpane Fairy sat down together on the soft grass beside the
road, with the mild and misty sky overhead, and the fairy took
from her pocket a piece of bread and cheese; she broke it in half
and one part she gave to Teddy. It seemed to him that he had
never tasted anything so good, for, as the fairy remarked, they
were both of them hungry.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After they had finished it all to the very last
bit, the fairy brushed the crumbs from her lap, and, sitting
there with the soft wind blowing about them and the black roofs
of the city in the distance, the Counterpane Fairy told him the
story of the King of the Black-Country and the Princess
Aureline.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Far off yonder toward the east, where the sky
looks so pale and bright," began the fairy, "there lives a king,
who is called King Whitebeard, because his beard is as white as
snow. He had only one child, a daughter named the Princess
Aureline, and she was as beautiful as the day and as good as she
was beautiful.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Because she was so good and beautiful princes
used to come from all over the world seeking her hand in
marriage, and among them came the King of the Black-Country, the
richest and most powerful of them all.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"The Princess Aureline would have nothing to
say to him, however, because he was wicked as well as rich, so at
last the King of the Black-Country gathered his army together and
marching against King Whitebeard he conquered him and carried off
the Princess Aureline captive.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Now there are great rejoicings in the Black
King's country, but the Princess Aureline sits and grieves all
the time, and nothing the King can do can make her smile. The
more the Black King does, the more she grieves, but she is so
very beautiful that the King would deny her nothing except to let
her go home to her father."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"I should like to see a princess," said
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"So you shall," said the fairy, "for you are a
great magician now, and you have come here to do what no other
hero in the world dares to do; you have come to rescue the
Princess Aureline and carry her back to her own
country."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Do you mean I am a real magician?" asked
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Why, yes," said the fairy. "Don't you see you
are dressed in a magician's robe? And there is your magic-chest
on the grass beside you. Look!" So saying the fairy drew a mirror
of polished steel from under her cloak and held it up before
Teddy, and as he looked into it he hardly knew himself; he was
dressed in a black hood, and a long black robe strangely woven
about the hem with characters in white, and he held a white staff
in his hand. Beside him on the grass was a box bound round with
iron, and that was his magic-box.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After he had looked in the mirror for a while
the fairy hid it away again under her cloak. "Now come," she
said, "for it is time we were journeying on."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"But what have I in my box?" asked Teddy, as he
picked it up and joined the fairy, who was already hobbling along
toward the city.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Don't you remember?" said the fairy. "It's
your circus."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, yes, I remember now," said
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After a while he and the fairy reached the
city, and everywhere along the street were people laughing and
dancing and feasting, and all the houses were hung with white and
black flags. The black flags were for the King of the
Black-Country, and the white flags were for the Princess
Aureline. Everywhere they came the people made way for them and
whispered, "Look! look! That is the great magician who had come
to show his magic before the Princess Aureline."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">At last they reached an open square, and there
was the greatest crowd of all. On a raised platform covered with
silver cloth, and with steps leading up to it, were two thrones;
upon one of the thrones sat a tall, fierce-looking man dressed in
black velvet, and with a crown upon his head cut entirely from
one great black diamond; upon the other throne sat a beautiful
young princess. She was as pale as a lily and as beautiful as the
day, and was dressed in shimmering white. Her hands were clasped
in her lap and her face was very sad.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">On the steps that led to this platform stood
two heralds in black and white with trumpets in their hands, and
all about were ranged soldiers two and two. They made Teddy think
of the toy soldiers he had been playing with, only they were as
big as men, and instead of being gay with red paint they were in
black.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">As soon as Teddy and the Counterpane Fairy
appeared in this square, the two heralds blew a loud blast and
come down to meet them. "Make way! make way for the magician!"
they cried, and they escorted him and the fairy through the crowd
to the foot of the steps.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The King of the Black-Country stared at him,
and his eyes were so black and piercing that Teddy felt
afraid.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Are you the great magician?" he
asked.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Yes, I am," answered Teddy, bowing.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Then let us see some of this magic that we
have been hearing about," said the King; "and harkye, Magician,
if you can make the Princess smile you shall have whatsoever you
wish, even to the half of my treasure."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy bowed again, and then he set the chest on
the ground, and drawing from his girdle an iron key he unlocked
it and put back the lid. There was the paper circus, just as he
and Harriett had cut it out: the acrobat and the lovely lady, the
horses, the clown, the ring-master, -- not one of them was left
out.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">With his magic wand, Teddy drew upon the ground
a circle, and then, while everybody round craned and stretched
their necks to see what he was about, he took out the figures and
set them, one by one, in the ring. Then he waved his wand over
them and cried "Abraca-dabraca-dee!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">All the people stood on tiptoes, and the King
himself leaned forward to see, -- but nothing
happened.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Abraca-dabraca-dee!" cried Teddy
again.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Still nothing happened; he looked around at the
crowd of people, at the grim-looking soldiers, and the King, and
his heart sank.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Abraca-dabraca-dee!" he cried for the third
time, striking the ground with his wand.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then a wonderful thing happened. The circle he
had drawn upon the ground began to spread, just as a circle does
in the water after one has thrown a stone into it. Now it was a
great circus ring, and the paper circus itself had changed to a
real circus. The clown walked about, joking, with his hands in
his pockets; the ring-master cracked him whip; the paper horses
were two magnificent steeds, one as black as night, and one as
white as milk, that cantered round and round, while the music
sounded, and all the people far away on the outside of the ring
clapped and applauded.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Wonderful! wonderful!" cried the King of the
Black-Country.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">But now there was something more that was
wonderful. As the black horse cantered round, Teddy ran to him
and leaped upon his back, light as a feather, and there he rode,
his black robe with the white figures flying and fluttering
around him.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then, still riding around, he unfastened his
gown and threw it from him, and there he was dressed in white and
silver, and his magic wand was changed to a little silver
whip.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">After that he leaped up into the air, and
turned a somersault, lighting again upon his horse, while the
music played louder and louder.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy rode round and round, now riding
backward, now forward, now on one foot, now on his hands with his
feet in the air. Then he leaped upright, and putting his fingers
to his mouth he gave a shrill whistle. At that the white steed
suddenly dashed into the ring and galloped up beside the black
one, and now Teddy rode with a foot on each. Faster and faster he
rode, crying "Houp-la!" and even the King clapped his hands. Once
and twice he rode round the ring and past the platform, but as
they came round for the third time, Teddy waved his whip in the
air. "Houp-la!" he cried. "Up! up!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">With that his steeds suddenly leaped from the
ring and up the steps of the platform to the very top. There
Teddy sprang from them and caught the Princess Aureline by the
hand. "I have come to rescue you!" he cried, and before the King
could move or speak he had set her upon the white horse, he had
sprung upon the black, and with a clatter of hoofs they were
dashing down the steps and across the square.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Then the King of the Black-Country started to
his feet. "Stop them! stop them!" he cried.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The soldiers had been standing as though turned
to stone, but at the King's voice they started forward, reaching
out to catch the bridles of the horses, but again Teddy raised
his magic whip.</font></p>
          
          <pre>"Abraca-dabraca-dee!<br>
           As you were once you shall be!"</pre>

<p><font size="5">h e cried.</font></p>
<p><font size="5">At the magic words every soldier's arm fell by
his side, their eyes changed to little black dots, their faces
grew rounder, their legs stiffened, and there they stood, nothing
more nor less than wooden soldiers just like the one
--<i>were</i> they his own soldiers? And the Princess! Was she
only the doll that Harriett had forgotten the night before and
that Teddy had set up against his knees to watch the show? Were
the streets only black and white silk?</font></p>

<p><font size="5">There he was, back in his own room with the
little wooden soldiers and the paper circus. There was the square
of silk with the book under it, and the Counterpane Fairy sitting
on his knees.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh! but, Counterpane Fairy," cried Teddy,
"what became of us? Did we get away? Oh, I didn't want to come
out of the story just yet!"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Why, of course you escaped," said the fairy.
"How could the King stop you after you had changed his soldiers
into wood?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"And what became of you?" asked
Teddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Oh, I took the clown's cap," said the fairy,
"for it was the wishing-cap, and fast as you and the Princess
rode back to the country of King Whitebeard I was there before
you."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Teddy thought for a while and then he heaved a
deep sigh. "I wish I really had a circus horse," he said, "and
could ride round and have all the people watching and shouting.
But what did the Princess say when she found I had rescued
her?"</font></p>

<p><font size="5">"Hark!" said the fairy, "isn't that your mother
coming along the hall? I must be going. Oh, my poor bones! What a
hill it is to go down! Oh dear, dear, dear!"</font></p>
